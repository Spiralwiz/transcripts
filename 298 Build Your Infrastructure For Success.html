            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/TwuutU9yUGE' target='_blank'>Build Your Infrastructure For Success</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>The importance of creating supporting environments</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of creating a supportive environment to live a high consciousness life, which is not accidental but deliberate. He stresses the importance of creating practical structures that make living one's highest values easy, automatic, and less resistant. 
</li><li><b>Infrastructure as strategic reserves and capacity</b>: Leo likens infrastructure to strategic reserves and capacity, drawing a parallel between personal and societal infrastructure. He emphasizes the importance of high-quality infrastructure to facilitate the growth of individuals and societies.   
</li><li><b>Overcoming challenges through infrastructure enhancement</b>: Leo discusses the importance of overcoming challenges in life through enhancing personal infrastructure, using his own life example of how he used pens and post-it notes to capture insights. Over time, he refined the system to suit his needs, providing an example of personal infrastructure development.
</li><li><b>The importance of thoroughly constructed infrastructure</b>: Leo points out that while spirituality and personal development are important, they should not overshadow the pragmatic and utilitarian requirements of life. Infrastructure plays a vital role in facilitating the journey to a high consciousness state.
</li><li><b>Listing top 10 values for successful infrastructure</b>: Leo suggests listing the top 10 values and aligning them with personal infrastructure. This involves identifying processes, mechanisms, and objects that make living by those values easy, and consistently setting them up in one's environment.
</li><li><b>Comprehensive approach to infrastructure building</b>: Leo shares his own experiences of building infrastructure for success in his life. This entailed a deliberate and comprehensive approach, from what might seem like simple tasks to larger scale planning and execution.
</li><li><b>Understanding the role of infrastructure in development</b>: Citing politics and third World countries as an example, Leo highlights the causal relationship between good infrastructure and development. He takes notice of social issues like corruption, violence, and health problems prevalent in such countries due to their low-quality infrastructure.
</li><li><b>Exception of India in the infrastructure-development relationship</b>: Leo mentions India as an exception in the usual relationship between infrastructure and development. Despite its low-quality infrastructure, India has a high concentration of spiritual masters due to their cultural emphasis on spirituality and personal development.      
</li><li><b>Infrastructure to enhance spiritual journey</b>: Leo suggests that setting up the right environment can make the spirituality journey easy and automatic. By creating a favorable and deliberatively designed environment, one can live by their highest ideals and values with less effort. It allows individuals to focus on their spiritual or self-development journey rather than battling environmental barriers.
</li><li><b>Optimization of infrastructure to capture insights</b>: Leo describes how he optimized his environment with post-it notes and pens throughout his home and car to ensure that he never runs out of ways to capture his insights. He emphasizes that this may seem like a minor detail, but it is the attention to these small things that lead to greater insights. 
</li><li><b>Use of technology to capture insights</b>: Leo notes his experimentation with various physical and digital voice recorders. After purchasing and trying out several options, he ended up settling on a voice recorder app for his phone. This process involved significant monetary investment and time, but the resultant system allows him to capture insights while on the move, significantly increasing his productivity and effectiveness.
</li><li><b>Implementation of data backup system</b>: Leo shares the example of an automatic backup system he built for his business files. It consists of over 36 terabytes of disk space that automatically backs up all data from his laptop, desktop, and camera. With this system in place, he mitigates the risk of significant data loss that could potentially disrupt alignment with his life purpose.
</li><li><b>Balancing technical work with personal and spiritual development</b>: Leo makes a point about the importance of effectively balancing technical work with personal and spiritual development. Despite this technical work, such as researching the right computers and software, not being inherently spiritual, it provides the necessary infrastructure for him to express his spiritual insights.
</li><li><b>Considering Hard and Soft infrastructure</b>: Leo discusses the importance of not just physical infrastructure (hard), like technology and tools, but also the non-material aspects (soft), such as speaking ability and creative thinking. Though soft infrastructure is more challenging to build due to its intangible nature, it is vital for personal growth and development.
</li><li><b>Alignment with highest values and life purpose</b>: Throughout his process of building infrastructure, he constantly considers his highest values and life purpose. He thinks about how the infrastructure enables him to better align with and fulfill his purpose and values. His goal is not merely to make his work more efficient but to make his job easier to follow and to stay aligned with his purpose and values.
</li><li><b>Building Abilities and Skills</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of building soft skills and abilities to enhance one's life purpose, such as speaking, creative, humor, and relationship-building skills. He explains how these skills, even though they are intangible, can enhance one's ability to live out their values and follow their life purpose. Techniques and infrastructure exist to build these skills over time.
</li><li><b>Technical Skills</b>: Leo highlights the importance of acquiring technical skills required to follow through on one's values and purpose, such as language skills, business skills, marketing skills or computer skills.
</li><li><b>Ambitious Dreams and Infrastructure</b>: Leo discusses how ambitious dreams can sometimes seem unachievable due to a lack of technical skills or long-term planning abilities. However, with the right infrastructure and development of necessary skills, these dreams can be realized.
</li><li><b>Non-Material Infrastructure</b>: Non-material or mental infrastructure, such as creative abilities or mindset, is deemed more powerful than material infrastructure. Despite it being harder to work with, its development offers the highest leverage and the most dramatic increase in efficiency and results.
</li><li><b>Infrastructure to Reduce Busy Work</b>: Leo emphasizes that infrastructure aids in freeing individuals from low-yield and low-fulfillment busy work, which often leads to chronic resistance. Infrastructure requires an investment of time, energy, and money. It allows people to focus more on living their core values.
</li><li><b>Investing in Oneself</b>: Leo highlights how material resources can be effective for personal development. Strategic investments into oneself, such as buying a new computer, books, or coaching, can enhance one's infrastructure for personal development. However, he also clarifies that growth is not solely dependent on money or investments - some of the most powerful ways to grow are free.
</li><li><b>Long-term Construction of Infrastructure</b>: Leo encourages individuals to take up the responsibility of building infrastructure necessary for their growth, alignment with their purpose, and living of their values. He highlights how powerful and fulfilling it can be to have one's hard and soft infrastructure in place, serving their purpose and making the living of values effortless. He cautions against expecting the infrastructure to already be in place, reminding viewers that it needs to be self-constructed and tailored to individual needs.
</li><li><b>Understanding One's Objective in Life</b>: It's vital to identify personal goals. Once these goals are clear, the individual can start building the necessary infrastructure to achieve them.
</li><li><b>Role of Personal Responsibility in Infrastructure Building</b>: Individuals must take responsibility for building their infrastructure, equipping themselves with the necessary resources to help achieve their dreams. 
</li><li><b>Pitfalls of Disregarding Practical Elements of Reality</b>: It's noted that people often focus on spirituality, erroneously thinking that everything will fall into place without efforts on building a practical structure. This mindset often results in no tangible results, despite having dreams and visions. 
</li><li><b>Necessity of Balance between Idealism and Pragmatism</b>: Dreaming big should be balanced with building the needed infrastructure. Overemphasis on either side could lead to neglect of the other, causing a disconnect from core values and purpose. 
</li><li><b>Dangers of Over-Identifying with Built Infrastructure</b>: There is a risk of over-identifying with infrastructure to the point where people mistake their created infrastructure (such as a successful business) as the source of their happiness and self-worth. Therefore, it's important to see infrastructure as only a tool that aids growth, not as a determinant of happiness or success.
</li><li><b>Infrastructure Building as a Lifelong Commitment</b>: Infrastructure building demands sustained effort throughout one's life, aiming at constant growth and refinement. It's not a short-term stint but rather a consistent life-long commitment.
</li><li><b>Utilizing Available Resources</b>: Leo encourages the use of resources on his website, including a downloadable worksheet that can assist in determining what kind of infrastructure needs to be built and how to avoid getting trapped in the process. 
</li><li><b>Community Support for Personal and Spiritual Development</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of utilizing the Actualized.org forum as a source of support and connection. The forum serves as a platform for exchanging ideas with like-minded individuals, sharing resources, and getting questions answered, contributing to a less lonely journey of personal and spiritual development.
