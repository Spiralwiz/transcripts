hey this is leo for actualize.org and in this video
we're going to talk about personal power let's talk about
what personal power is why it's an important topic in
the first place and how you can develop it all
right so first let's talk about what is it and
why is it important personal power i love this idea
because to me in order to go out there and
live an amazing kind of life to live the charge
life that i talk about to have the feelings in
life that you want both the external rewards and the
internal feelings of like excitement and fulfillment and happiness and
love to get those things i think it's impossible to
get those without a real really reasonably high level of
personal power personal power what that means to me is
your ability to go out there and control your environment
but then of course controlling yourself so it's the power
that you have it's your willpower it's what you can
get accomplished because and you might have noticed this that
have you noticed that there are different levels of personal
power in different people that you know that you've run
across in your in your life and this is very
apparent once you once you make this connection is that
it's very clear to see on certain people that they
just you can point to the guy and say wow
that guy has a lot of personal power and you
can point at this person here and say no this
guy he's got no personal power whatsoever right what's going
to be the difference well let's take a look at
some examples a guy who has no personal power what
is his life going to be like well i would
say it's going to look something like this and we're
stereotyping but i'm just going to start throwing out stereotypes
well he's not going to have his financial situation in
place his bank account is going to be at zero
maybe even negative he's going to be overdrafted he's going
to be using a lot of credit cards and he's
going to be struggling to pay the bills he's going
to be always worried about money what else well his
health is probably going to be very bad he's going
to be eating junk food he's going to be eating
fast food he's not going to care about his health
at all he's going to be at least 20 pounds
overweight he's going to be unhealthy for his age he's
going to have wrinkles he's going to look bad he's
probably going to engage in unhealthy activities like smoking excessive
drinking and maybe drugs of various to various degrees and
so he's gonna he's gonna have that he's gonna really
have a lot of trouble with his health he's also
gonna have trouble with relationships because he doesn't have much
self-awareness he doesn't have as much personal control so he's
gonna have very uh very fragmented relationships very a lot
of tension in relationships his relationships tend to be getting
like roller coasters big ups and also very big downs
and then of course a lot of a big a
deep history of broken relationships in the past and maybe
even trauma and abuse there both either taking it or
receiving it so that will be a problem he's not
going to have really any direction in life he's not
going to be very self-aware he's not going to have
a lot of goals he's not going to be out
there being ambitious and pushing himself he's not going to
be doing too well in his career he's not really
going to have much status in his career because it's
impossible to accomplish anything big career-wise without having personal power
or working to develop it so he's going to have
that area of his life not handled and of course
that's not going to really help him with his finances
so this pro this person is probably going to be
stuck in some very boring low-paying nine-to-five job that has
no prospects for uh for improvement or advancement and he's
certainly gonna be disgruntled and he's gonna hate the world
and he's not gonna really enjoy that job or he's
just gonna kind of go through it humming along and
really not having any sense of contribution to the world
and in fact this idea of impact or contribution to
the world is going to be totally foreign to him
because he can't even fathom that because he's so overwhelmed
by all the problems in his life this person is
also going to have a horrible mental state internal mental
state he's going to be worrying all the time he's
going to be anxious he's always going to be reactive
to everything that's happening in his life and this is
going to be further deteriorating his health and further deteriorating
his relationships and further deteriorating his situation at work for
example he might have so many problems in his life
that he's always late to work or he's always angry
and uh abrupt in relationships or he's totally unconcerned about
his health and he's extremely unhealthy so that is the
person with no personal power kind of a grim picture
right you're probably not quite in that shape i hope
you're not if you are well more power to you
then you found the right videos and this is a
good place to start and then you need a lot
more of my help than than i thought you did
but let's take a look at the person who has
personal power this is the person who is basically the
mirror opposite of that person this person has excellent finances
he's not worried about his finances because he's making more
money than he can spend and he's not spending it
that lavishly yet at the same time he's got everything
that he wants because he's fulfilled by the things that
he's getting then this person has amazing relationships because he's
worked on himself he's always developing himself he's apathetic he's
understanding other of other people and he's always trying to
improve and so over time his relationships get better and
better and better doesn't mean he doesn't have problems but
it means that he's much more masterful there he's able
to control himself he's also much better with his career
he's probably on track with a great career his career
probably has good prospects he probably enjoys what he's doing
and if he really did it right and he has
a lot of personal power then he loves what he's
doing and he's totally committed to it and it's his
life calling he's also probably concerned about his health and
he's looking out for his health maybe he's a little
bit overweight but he knows that it's an issue and
he's working to resolve it or he's extremely fit because
he's actually gone through and gone through the process of
optimizing his health because he knows that it's important to
do that and that the effects of your health will
spill over into all the parts of your life and
he cares about the quality of his life he's also
very grounded internally so he's got willpower he doesn't procrastinate
he's not always worrying and overthinking he's calm he's not
anxious he's comfortable in himself he's got a pretty good
level of confidence and self-esteem and he's able to go
out there and set goals for himself and accomplish pretty
challenging things once in a while he's able to go
out there and do it and sometimes he's really able
to make something amazing happen he's able to set a
really ambitious goal and do it make it happen spend
the time that it needs that needs to be spent
and he's able to overcome the emotional challenges involved with
getting something pushing something big through like that and he's
able to improve his life steadily day after day month
after month year after year and he's got a lot
of friends because people like that kind of person and
they're attracted to him they see something in him that
they want for themselves which is the personal power although
usually that personal power is not directly envied it's more
like the external rewards of the personal power envied but
most people don't see through what the external rewards are
coming from and that is the personal power so personal
power is a matter of mastering yourself it's self-mastery it's
mastering your thoughts and your emotions and then that spills
out into all the different domains of your life whether
it's health business money relationships career anything else so how
do you develop it is the question well you develop
it through a process through a process it's not something
that you can do in one day there's no like
one single technique but you develop it by undertaking this
process and first you start by saying do you want
to have personal power is personal power something that you
value do you have a vision of how much personal
power are you gonna have five ten fifteen or twenty
years from now i do i know that i want
as much personal power as i can get because i
have big goals for myself i'm ambitious i want to
change the world i want to go out there and
rock it i want to live an amazing life i
want to die with no regrets and to do that
i know that i want to be like this guy
and i want the power i want the willpower i
want control over myself in order to create the kind
of life that i want because some of those things
i don't have right now and where i started i
didn't have good health i had horrible health i didn't
have good relationships i had horrible relationships i didn't have
any money or or a business so i had to
work on that i had to work on all these
things and i had bad internal mindsets i had pessimistic
thinking negative thinking i was always skeptical and critical and
that's where i was and now i'm at a totally
different evolved level and that's because i've been doing a
lot of develop personal development for about five years and
i continue i anticipate continuing going down this road and
getting some really amazing results in fact i just think
that i i just kind of tapped in to this
process even though i've been doing it for about five
years i just tapped into it i'm really getting a
taste of how awesome it is and i feel like
my results are now just starting to accelerate even faster
i'm not getting diminishing returns i'm getting accelerating returns from
this so this is a process this is the process
of self-mastery self-actualization this is why i created actualize.org is
to help people understand that this is out there for
them but then to give them the tools to actually
go out there and do it that's why i publish
