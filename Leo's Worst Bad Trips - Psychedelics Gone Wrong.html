[Music] do you want to hear about all my bad
trips i thought you would so in this episode i'm
going to share all the worst trips that i've had
on psychedelics and i'm going to do a bit of
introspection here for myself and also for you as to
what is really going on inside of a bad trip
what causes them also perhaps how to deal with them
and also how to avoid them for yourself so it
should go without saying that if you're going to be
a serious psychonaut and you're going to be doing a
lot of trips 50 trips 100 trips or more in
your life you're necessarily going to have some bad trips
what are called bad trips now are they really bad
i mean it's all relative it all depends once you
come out of them and you look at them back
in retrospect then they're not going to look so bad
and in fact you might be very grateful for them
and thankful for them because they will teach you valuable
lessons just like in life you can have horrific situations
happen to you in life this happens all the time
to people bankruptcies divorces children dying health conditions cancers and
[Music] all sorts of of stuff like this that you
would not wish upon yourself and you maybe even wouldn't
wish upon your enemies because it's so bad but then
in retrospect you look at it and you say i
mean yeah it was i would not do it again
if i had the choice but it's made me who
i am and there were profound lessons that i learned
and that something very important would be lost if life
was just all positivity and rainbows and butterflies and all
goodness and none of the hard stuff all right so
let's get into it overall i would say i've been
blessed not to have that many bad trips but i
can definitely think of at least a couple and really
more like probably five or ten at least two that
were really traumatic we might say and problematic and then
maybe upwards towards ten that were difficult and i wouldn't
want to relive those experiences and so we have we
have a sort of a gradation of scale of how
bad troops can get and i don't think i've experienced
the worst of the bad trips that are possible and
the reason that is is because from the very beginning
i've told you guys that i'm very careful with how
i've used psychedelics in the past i treat them very
seriously i understand the potential for how bad the trips
can get and that's precisely why i'm so careful with
them and i make sure that my doses aren't too
high and so on but you know even if you're
very careful if you trip a lot eventually something will
go sideways you'll take too much you'll get too cocky
and then bad stuff will happen so anyways the first
bad trip that i had was on mushrooms it was
on four grams of mushrooms and the way that this
one came about was that i this was when i
was first starting psychedelics i started with mushrooms and i
took two grams of mushrooms and i loved it so
much it was so amazing that i decided that in
the next few days or in the next week i'm
going to do more i'm going to do 4 grams
and my goal was that i'm going to go from
from 2 grams to four grams to six grams to
eight grams like i wanted to work my way up
to to really high doses back then i didn't really
understand what i was getting into not fully and so
i doubled my dose from two to four grams and
i didn't quite understand that that was not just going
to double the potency of the trip it ended up
like quadrupling the potency of the trip and so what
happened was that i took it i remember it was
coming up usually takes about 30 minutes for the mushrooms
to kick in and they were kicking in around the
30 minute mark and then i i noticed that it
was kicking in so strong that i started to get
this sense in my mind like oh man i don't
want it to be this strong it's getting too strong
to the point where it's uncomfortable now and then it
was getting even stronger than that and so the come
up was coming up and i was i was noticing
how strong it is and i just my mind started
sort of started to want to go back i wanted
to like press the undo button and i started to
tell myself things like uh i wish i didn't take
these mushrooms today i don't feel like tripping today but
of course it's too late so one of the lessons
when you're doing psychedelics that will help you to avoid
bad trips is that when you're going into a trip
make sure that you're really engaged with what's going to
happen that your mind is not elsewhere that you're not
thinking that you would rather be somewhere else doing something
else like make sure that you've set aside the entire
day you're not in any kind of rush there's nothing
else on your mind no other kind of business that
you're worried about so you can fully go to the
trip and you have to almost be how would i
put it you have to be sort of morally prepared
to deal with what's going to arise because difficult things
can arise and sometimes i'm just in a mood where
i don't want to deal with difficult things so if
i'm in if i'm in that kind of mood i
shouldn't be tripping because the trip could bring up difficult
things and i also have to be in a mood
to contemplate and i also have to be in a
mood where i'm not bored or tired of tripping because
i tripped just recently and that was sort of a
problem with this particular mushroom trip is that not enough
time passed between the first time that i did it
and then the second time that i'm now taking four
grams i think it was only like a week that
passed the problem was not the tolerance that wasn't the
problem the problem is that usually the way it works
for me is that i take a psychedelic insights arise
and lessons and revelations and then i have to ponder
those and mold them over and integrate them and that
can take anywhere from a few days to weeks to
months to even a year or more to integrate all
that and if i didn't chew thoroughly digest all of
that material and then i go trip again then it
can feel like it's it's too much too fast and
it's too soon it's almost like i would i won't
i would almost liken it to having sex if you're
having loss of sex then at some point you have
so much sex that you even become disinterested in the
sex but simply because you're in the habit of it
and maybe your partner wants it and maybe you've been
having sex a few times like a every day for
a few days in a row maybe by the third
or fourth day it's almost like you want to go
do something else because you're just you're tired of it
you're sick of it you need that space so that
it can become special again you don't want it to
be just this habitual thing that you do every single
day like a robot then the joy of sex is
lost if you have sex every single day for a
month you're gonna be so sick of sex now this
is difficult for many people who struggle getting sex this
is difficult for many people to actually believe that that's
true some of you are listening to this and thinking
like leo no i don't believe you if i could
have sex every day for a month i would be
thrilled that would be heaven but uh if you actually
do that you'll realize that no it's not heaven it
gets monotonous and you actually start to regret it because
you overdo it likewise with food you i mean if
you eat the same food too much too many days
in a row and you overfill yourself by the fourth
or fifth day you're gonna be sick of it you're
gonna need a break so it's just like that with
psychedelics except with psychedelics you need even longer periods of
time for a break at least a week maybe two
weeks maybe a couple months is usually what i find
is what i need so that then when i come
back now i'm i'm really ready you have to be
sort of thirsty for it right it can't just be
like oh yeah i could trip today or maybe i
could not that's not a good reason to trip a
good reason to trip is like i wake up in
the morning and i i sort of just introspect and
i remember like you know i haven't tripped for a
few months and now i'm really feeling like i'm ready
for more like i really want it i'm i'm excited
i want to explore i want to explore the psychedelic
train that's when it's a good day to trip now
when it's a bad day to trip is when you
wake up and you're like uh yeah i sho i
told myself i would trip today but i don't kind
of feel like it i would rather just slack off
and watch tv or i would rather just be online
looking at videos and stuff and just i want to
have an easy day but i told myself i would
trip so i'm gonna force myself to trip that's already
starting off on the wrong foot and that's sort of
how i started this mushroom trip is on that kind
of wrong foot and so i immediately regretted it and
i wanted to to back out of it but of
course you can't back out of it and then it
was a very high dose i'm also very sensitive to
psychedelics so it's a very high dose for me probably
what is four grams for me might be 8 grams
for the average person and so it came on really
strong and my entire visual field was just completely getting
twisted up and melting and going all crazy and since
these were some of my earliest trips i didn't have
a lot of good experience in terms of how how
twisted consciousness can get and so what happened was this
combination of me wanting to break out of it but
i couldn't so then i said well it's gonna last
like three hours it's usually about how long a solid
mushroom trip lasts for about three hours and i said
well i'll just tough it out for three hours but
see that was already the wrong attitude if you're going
in there trying to tough something out you're already in
a attitude of resistance not an attitude of openness and
curiosity not a passion or eagerness to explore to contemplate
anything and so what happened was that this trip was
sort of forced upon me i was resisting it i
wish it would stop but it couldn't so i was
just kind of begrudgingly going along and um and it
just kept getting stronger and stronger to the point where
i started to go into a state of what i
would call madness this was my first experience of madness
the madness of consciousness and so i started going down
these twisted rabbit holes of consciousness and infinite mind where
i started having these um what at the time seemed
like insane insights and visions like i would um start
to imagine that i am all the dinosaurs that used
to exist which of course is true you are all
the dinosaurs you imagined all the dinosaurs but this was
my first time starting to realize that i am all
the dinosaurs that i imagined all the dinosaurs and it
was very twisted then i went into all sorts of
other rabbit holes and it felt like i was losing
my mind and when you get stuck in one of
these rabbit holes especially on mushrooms because they're very twisty
you stop even believing that you're going to come out
of these rabbit holes and so the deepest rabbit hole
i went down was just this rabbit hole of imagining
myself completely losing my mind and not being able to
undo it and then so then i sort of went
into this fantasy that i lost my mind and that
i lost it permanently and then i would never come
out and that would basically be like a an old
man sitting in a wheelchair drooling uh because i lost
my mind and my family would have to like take
care of me that was that was sort of the
the deepest part of that rabbit hole and um it
felt like pure madness and because of that i was
able to develop an empathy for people who actually experienced
true madness people insane asylums and so forth but of
course then the trip ended and i came back but
it left me quite psychologically traumatized not physically but just
psychologically it shook me it showed me just how powerful
psychedelics can be i didn't i mean i read bad
trip reports in the past before taking that trip but
there's a big difference between just being told what a
bad trip is and then actually living through on yourself
and then you appreciate just how powerful these substances are
and so that trip was actually very foundational for me
in my psychonaut journeys because what it taught me is
it taught me to deeply respect mushrooms and all psychedelics
by extension and so after the trip passed i spent
that day just sitting sort of curled up in a
ball on the floor just sort of contemplating what the
[ __ ] just happened to me and trying to
make sense of it and i really couldn't make sense
of it but i asked myself like okay so what's
the lesson here what was this trying to teach me
and it was very clear that the purpose of this
trip was to teach me that as i'm going into
psychedelics deeper in the future this was like an early
shot across the bow that god gave me that these
are not tools to be trifled with like you have
to really respect the substance really respect the dosage don't
get cocky don't think that you're going to be able
to handle heroic dose don't trip when you're not feeling
like tripping like make sure you're really following the right
protocol and being extra careful and you're not doing it
from an egoic place you're not doing it for for
like a sort of artificial macho reason because in my
mind back then i thought like well i would do
two grams of mushrooms then four grams then six grams
then eight grams and i was going to work up
to like 20 grams of mushrooms that was that was
my egotistical sort of idea of what i'm going to
be doing over the next few months and so i
was quickly disabused of that notion that's not the proper
way to trip see that was a sort of a
preconceived plan that i had in my mind whereas really
the proper way to trip is that you trip one
trip at a time and you don't think too far
ahead in terms of what is the next trip going
to be how much should i take there's no preset
dosages you have to adjust and you have to be
fluid and you have to be willing to improvise so
you trip then you integrate the lessons from the trip
based on the lessons that you got you ask yourself
when should i trip again and maybe your intuition will
tell you in four months then that's how long it's
gonna take or maybe your intuition tells you i'm going
to trip the next day okay maybe that's correct because
there's something you didn't get and you need to trip
immediately to get some more insight or clarity on that
point and if that's the case then that's the case
then you trip the next day right so it can
be very variable and you got to be fluid enough
to improvise and to to work with that so that
was that bad trip and that bad trip my first
one is what saved me from having many more bad
trips in the future i still had a few bad
trips i'm going to tell you about here in a
minute but i could have had a lot more had
i not had that that difficult one really early on
which taught me that lesson and i really truly learned
that lesson deeply because you know what the greatest teacher
is suffering suffering exists for a reason it exists because
it can be extremely effective at teaching you lessons that
you wouldn't otherwise learn deep pain physical and emotional teaches
you lessons very quickly you touch a hot stove and
then you probably will never touch one again in your
life because you'll integrate that lesson so deeply because it
was so painful and that's what happened to me with
this mushroom trip ever since i'm i'm very careful with
mushrooms especially because i know how twisted they can be
the next bad trip that i had was with five
amio dmt and there were there were multiple bad trips
i had with five mio so let me discuss that
so the first and probably scariest trip i had on
five it was the very first time i tried it
i snorted a small amount of it just to test
maybe 10 milligrams or 50 i think it was 15
milligrams actually just to test what it was going to
be like because it was a totally new substance and
i knew how powerful it was from everything i read
so i took it and then i was shocked at
how quickly it came on it came on in about
five minutes and my consciousness was starting to transform in
such a radical way such an impossible way there was
such an expansion of consciousness that also i immediately started
to regret that i did this and then my mind
went into sort of a panic mode i al i
actually this is the closest i've come in my life
to a panic attack i'm not a panicky person i'm
not an anxious person i'm usually very calm and chill
but in this case my heart started beating fast i
could feel it i could hear it and that wasn't
so much a physical response to the 5meo it was
just that my mind was starting to as the trip
was coming on it was so radical in its nature
that my mind started to paint these these sort of
nightmare scenarios of where this is gonna go because i
had no idea where i was gonna go and i
was like in my mind i'm like well where is
this going like is it gonna go this place or
this place or this awful place or even this more
awful place and so it was like that and after
a few minutes of that i realized like [ __
] i i just want to go back to how
i was i want to go back to my original
sober state because this could go in some weird direction
that i don't want it to go and and that
just fed in because you see the whole problem with
psychedelics is that what they reveal to you is they
reveal to you that reality is your own imagination you're
projecting and constructing reality now in your sober state you're
not taking responsibility for that and your consciousness is so
crystallized and solidified that thoughts you think don't manifest in
the material world but when you're in a loosened more
fluid state from psychedelics then your thoughts start to manifest
in the material world and that can be freaky especially
if you're thinking bad thoughts so if you start thinking
that oh [ __ ] this trip is going to
go bad it's going to go in a sideways direction
that's exactly what's going to tend to manifest it's going
to become a self-fulfilling prophecy so to trip well you
need to be in a positive good state of mind
and you also need to have a certain control over
your own thought process so that you don't think into
negative territory and you can train yourself to do this
but it takes a while of tripping to to sort
of learn to surf atop the ways of waves of
consciousness that these psychedelics produce and so at this early
stage in my psychonaut journeys i didn't yet know how
to do that or learn how to do that and
so i had sort of a mini panic attack and
this was not even a large dose mostly the reason
it was such a negative trip for me is just
because my mind started to run wild with negative images
of where this trip will go and the trip didn't
even end up lasting very long it only lasted like
20 minutes and if i hadn't thought all those negative
thoughts it would have it would have been fine if
i just kind of accepted it surrendered to it and
just explored it and was curious about it and open
to it but i was starting to close down i
was starting to resist it and that's when you typically
would have a bad trip is when you start to
resist what's being shown to you or when you get
the idea that you want to go back to how
you were 10 minutes ago but you can't because it's
taking you in a forward direction you can't go back
when you're just starting your trip because the majority of
it is still ahead of you so anyways that that
spooked me and it almost spooked me to the point
where i didn't want to do 5meo again but a
few days later of course i knew logically that i
had to go back and redo 5mu again because that
was just a little test dose anyways it wasn't the
real deal and that i didn't get the full picture
of what five amigo dmt was i knew that that
was just sort of an entry point and it was
an awkward entry point and i got off on the
wrong foot but that doesn't mean i should stop doing
5mm gmt that would be a mistake and that was
exactly correct i intuited that a lot of people if
they would have had that first initial bad reaction they
would have said oh to hell with this i'm never
doing five emo again it sucks it doesn't feel good
it's scary it's terrible well you have to recognize that
that can easily just be an ego defense mechanism you
see your ego will construct all sorts of stories and
excuses for why you shouldn't do a nice solid dose
of 5mu tmt your ego knows this is this is
the end so it's going to invent all sorts of
excuses uh i've seen a lot of friends and other
people who take one dose of five meow dmt and
they don't really have a good experience on that initial
dose because it's so weird and alien it's hard to
really appreciate and enjoy it your first time just like
when you're trying a strange foreign cuisine the first time
you try it you're not gonna like it it takes
actually a few tries of some new foreign cuisine to
develop an appreciation for it have you noticed that so
it's like that with five million dmt and anyways so
i went back for a second dose and that went
much better even though it was higher it actually went
better because i was i was now more prepared for
what was to come and i was just willing to
surrender to it more and then the third dose was
also a bad trip but for different reasons so let
me talk about that and that was the highest dose
of 5mm that i've done which was 30 milligrams so
i basically worked up from from 15 to 20. well
there's a there was a 25 and then i went
to 30. so that was the fourth trip the 30
was i would say my most traumatic 5 meal experience
simply because at that dose given my level of sensitivity
to that substance and to all psychedelics what happened was
that i became so ridiculously conscious that it was a
frightening terrifying level of consciousness but beyond the physical fright
of it i mean the the psychological fright of it
there was there was actually a physical reaction uh so
what happened was that my neurological system was overwhelmed by
the intensity of the infinite consciousness that i was experiencing
to the point where i had a physical reaction where
like this energy shot through my entire body you might
call it kundalini energy and it shot out of my
fingers and out of my fingertips it wasn't a visible
energy it was um you couldn't see anything if you
were looking at me but there was such a powerful
explosion opening up from my heart and through all my
limbs and through the entire nervous system um that it
felt like my nervous system was overloaded like taking a
light bulb and connecting it to a lightning bolt imagine
what happens if you do that so it was just
way too much of a dose and this was the
moment where i first realized god i didn't even realize
myself as god i just realized that god existed this
was the first time i realized that god existed so
basically i discovered god at the peak of this trip
and it was so shocking and so awesome and terrifying
all at the same time and also so loving and
beautiful at the same time that it was too much
for my mind and for my body to physically contain
and so there was this sort of a negative overloading
of energy in my body that was discharged through my
fingertips it actually left scars and peeling of the skin
on my fingertips for months that lasted for months took
months for that to heal and um and it was
such a shocking revelation of infinity that it would take
me about a year to be able to integrate it
and to feel like i'm ready to trip again so
i didn't trip for basically a year and i was
frightened from tripping because it was just too much and
also i didn't understand exactly what it was that i
experienced i experienced infinity i knew that much but there's
so much depth to what infinity is and your mind
is trying to figure out what it is and how
to pin it down and how to make sense of
it and what does it mean what does infinity mean
it took me a good year of just contemplating that
thinking about it mulling it over until i felt like
i was ready to go back for more and when
i did go back for more i lowered my doses
and i hadn't done 30 milligrams ever since because it's
just too much it physically overwhelms the body and i
think it actually will damage the nervous system if you
do it at those quantities at least for me so
i call that a bad trip but i mean it
was one of the most powerful and most important experiences
i've ever had in my life the first time you
discover god that is the most that is one of
the most important experiences you'll ever have i mean it's
it's remarkable it's unbelievable it's magical but it's also terrifying
so it's a double-edged sword and so in my mind
with this trip i don't even consider it a bad
trip i consider it traumatizing but it was absolutely necessary
and crucial to my development and i wouldn't i wouldn't
change it for anything it was such an important trip
for me and now the trauma has been integrated and
worked through and it's gone so it's not like i'm
living with that trauma i'm long over it um it
took me about a year or two to get over
it and i did and now it's fine other bad
trips that i had i had a bad trip on
lsd there's a strange phenomenon i've noticed with psychedelics where
sometimes you take a psychedelic and it doesn't work exactly
like it normally does i don't know why maybe it's
because of some medicine i was taking or some supplement
that i was taking that week i don't know or
maybe it's just a fluke luck or something in my
psychology but sometimes i take a psychedelic and it doesn't
go normally it goes sideways what i call going sideways
when a trip goes sideways for some reason it feels
like the psychedelic is acting on you in a bit
of it like a sinister way for whatever reason it's
kind of sinister and you start getting kind of dark
thoughts it almost feels malevolent rather than benevolent and usually
i can tell very early into a trip when it's
going into that sinister territory for whatever reason i don't
know the reason but it's going in that sinister territory
and i find that i'm not able to control it
like if it wants to go in that direction it's
going to go in that direction and even though i
want it to go in a more benevolent direction if
i try to push it towards the benevolent direction it
still keeps going in the sinister direction and so that's
what happened in this lsd trip and uh i just
started having thoughts that didn't feel like they were my
own it felt like i was out of character for
myself because usually i'm pretty positive optimistic person i tend
to think along certain lines of thought but in this
trip my mind just started to kind of go haywire
into some weird alien direction i don't know why i
was having weird thoughts that were just uncharacteristic of of
me and i didn't like where those thoughts were going
and i didn't feel like i really had much control
over them and again it felt like the trip was
sort of forcing itself on me and then i wanted
out of the trip but of course i couldn't get
out so what i did was i started to use
a little trick that i like to use when i'm
in a bad trip situation is i try to change
the setting and this is a great trick that you
can try to use just to sort of reboot your
mind and reboot your mood and your emotional system you
can actually shift your state by moving your body physically
dancing to some music or in this case just changing
rooms so that's what i did i went from the
living room to the bathroom thought well maybe that will
change things and it can because your living room has
a different mood than your bathroom like if your living
room starts to feel sinister you can go to your
bathroom turn on the lights make it very bright and
then maybe those bright lights and whatever you see in
the bathroom will cheer you up it's amazing how just
how simple something like that can can be and you
can actually see this in children like with babies and
small children maybe a child starts to cry have you
seen this a baby starts crying and for some silly
reason someone stole the baby's toy or maybe somebody accidentally
bumped into the baby now the baby's crying and the
baby can get stuck in that frame of mind they
can just keep crying and crying and crying and crying
for the next 30 minutes but what you can do
is you can you can shift the baby's attention to
something else you can crack a joke you can literally
take the baby you can cuddle the baby you can
take it in a different room you can turn the
lights on and off you can you know you can
stick your tongue out you can make some funny some
funny like uh facial gestures and whatever and the baby's
attention could shift out of that negative spiral of bad
mood because it's thinking about the bad thing that just
happened to it a minute ago but if you shift
its attention to something new something funny something weird whatever
grab its attention just shift it away then uh it's
remarkable the baby can start laughing and giggling as though
the bad thing a minute ago didn't even happen the
baby just forgets about it and so very much on
psychedelics you can use this trick on yourself sometimes it'll
work not always will it work because you are a
little bit more sophisticated than a baby and you have
a little bit more stickiness to your mind so anyways
you know like i went to the bathroom or just
like i laid on the floor looking at the carpet
things like that and eventually i decided to go outside
so that's like the biggest shift you could make if
you're tripping indoors and you're having a bad trip indoors
after you try all the different rooms and you try
all that stuff and it doesn't make you pop out
of your bad mood and negative thought spirals go outside
because outside will be a very significant shift so i
went outside and i was in the sun basking in
the sun looking at the trees and a lot of
times that will shift your state and your mood but
in this case it didn't so i was still having
my bad trip outside and there were some people walking
around outside looking at me not that they really saw
anything different about me but um kind of made me
paranoid and self-conscious but i i was just outside and
i knew that at that point i knew that well
i've exhausted all my options for trying to you know
trick myself out of this bad trip and so i
won't be able to do it so i just i
gotta tough it out and so that's what i did
i just toughed it out um it didn't feel very
good for an hour or two and then i i
came back inside at some point i laid on the
carpet i was kind of in misery on the carpet
for 30 minutes or so and then just something clicked
and i popped out of it popped out of the
bad mood and then from then on it was all
easy and nice and to this day i still i
can't really understand why that mood was there why my
mind was going into these sinister directions it's just how
it was and that's what will happen sometimes to you
so be prepared for that and so what do you
do in that situation well you can try to manipulate
your trips in order to get them to go in
the direction you want but if your manipulations fail you
have to accept that and just resign yourself to wherever
the trip is taking you in general you don't want
to over manipulate your trips because if you get too
manipulative with them that's you imposing your ego too much
on what consciousness wants to show you and then that's
going to lead to more and more resistance so at
some point when the resistance becomes too high the manipulation
becomes too high you have to remember to tell yourself
like okay why am i even manipulating all this let
me just experience the badness of it nothing wrong with
experiencing some badness remind yourself of that um and then
usually as soon as you kind of do that then
it's all downhill from there because a lot of the
bad part of the bad trip is just the anticipation
of how bad it's going to get more so than
how bad it really is it's that old saying of
you know the only thing you have to fear is
fear itself and that's sort of a lot of what
a bad trip is is mostly you anticipating something negative
and that anticipation is itself the worst part of the
whole experience so that happened to me let's see what
other bad trips that i have i had one very
difficult trip on for aco dmt i haven't talked much
about that i plugged some for eco dmt it wasn't
a large quantity it was a very small quantity it
was maybe 10 milligrams or so and for some reason
it hit me so hard and the problem with that
trip is that you know sometimes i'll do a trip
where i'm deliberately planning to go very deep and i'm
taking a a relatively high dose and i know i'm
taking a relatively high ghost because i'm ready to go
deep other times i take a trip where i'm just
like testing a new substance and it's a mild dose
and i'm just doing it for tester's sake just to
see how it is so that in the future when
i trip on it i can you know adjust the
dose properly so i can do a nice deep proper
trip so that's what i was planning with this trip
with foreign dmt i took the smallest dose that i
would normally take just 10 milligrams and i was expecting
it to be mild and easy but what shocked me
was that even at 10 milligrams when plugging it it
was so freaking powerful that it completely took me by
surprise and i really really wasn't in the mood to
trip that deep but of course it was too late
so i was in it and there was no going
back and so i just had to i just had
to deal with it and um for echo dmt what
does it feel like it feels very similar to mushrooms
it's pretty twisted you get a lot of visual hallucinations
on it very wavy the whole room becomes very wavy
and it's very fantastical like you can you can dream
some crazy stuff on foreign at least i can and
so um i had some sort of shocking insights about
the fact that everything is imaginary and just how imaginary
everything is i started to realize that my entire past
is imaginary my childhood is imaginary and this was some
some of the first times that i started to realize
that and it was quite difficult to integrate but still
thanks to my experience with mushrooms that first time that
i talked about my first bad trip with mushrooms i
was able to deal with this bad trip better than
i did with my first mushroom bed trip and uh
it didn't traumatize me as much it didn't scare me
as much because i knew that you know i've already
been through some bad trips in the past and that
gives me confidence that i can weather this new storm
that is coming and so that's also a nice benefit
of having some bad trips in your experienced base because
you can then trust yourself to be able to handle
it especially if you've handled previous bad trips relatively well
then you you trust that you can also survive this
you know this too shall pass it's that old saying
and so that was foreign and um to this day
i haven't done foreign dmt again just because i like
i really respect that substance it's way more powerful than
it seems and part of the problem with foreign dmt
is that when i was going into it from the
trip reports that i've read i always read a bunch
of trip reports before i try a new substance because
i want to get a sense of you know what
am i getting myself into here how serious is this
going to be most of the trip reports for foreign
tmt they said oh it's just like mushrooms and i
said well if it's just like mushrooms i've already done
that so i'm ready for it can't be that bad
and i'm going to do a very low dose of
it and so the expectations that i had were incorrect
maybe that's how it works for other people but it
certainly doesn't work that way for me with foreign it's
more serious than mushrooms and it's way more potent than
mushrooms even at 10 milligrams so um maybe for me
for uh 10 milligrams of foreign is equivalent to three
to four grams of of mushrooms i would estimate but
i would say it's even a little bit more serious
mushroom's a little bit more playful whereas four echo dmt
is more serious for me it's not a it's definitely
not a recreational psychedelic for me whereas some people will
talk about it in a recreational way so that threw
me off a little bit so another lesson that i
learned from that experience and from other experiences of other
substances is that just because other people are talking about
a psychedelic in a recreational manner and they say oh
this psychedelic is good for partying or oh yeah it's
it's easy there's not a lot of mind [ __
] to this one you can't rely on that maybe
it'll go that way but what i noticed for me
is that a lot of psychedelics that people claim to
be just like party drugs or recreational or just kind
of like light and fun you can be social on
them and stuff and you can have sex on them
and stuff like that for me it's not like that
for me it's much more existential maybe it's because of
my genetics maybe it's because of the way my mind
works i don't know maybe a combination of both probably
so nowadays if i was trying a new substance i
would be much more skeptical and i would err on
the side of presuming that the substance is not going
to be a recreational substance but it's going to be
serious basically every new substance i approach as though it's
going to be a very serious substance because it's better
to over overestimate than it is to underestimate these things
so that's a lesson that i learned that helps me
now to avoid bad trips other bad trips that i've
had uh the worst chemical that i've ever taken you
want to hear what that one is so um i've
talked in the past my experiences with dpt it's a
beautiful visionary psychedelic very powerful so to be careful with
it of course i've talked about five meow dmt but
then i tried a new research chemical called 5meodpt and
i was thinking like well 5mu dmt is amazing and
dpt is amazing so isn't it logical that if you
combine 5meodmt and dpt into 5meodpt that that should be
pretty amazing right that's what i thought that's what i
was hoping for so i try a bit of it
like 10 milligrams and this is the most horrible chemical
i've ever put in my body it's definitely psychedelic but
the problem with it is is that it feels almost
like a toxin or a poison coursing through your nervous
system it doesn't feel pleasant at all your thoughts become
discombobulated when you turn your head it feels like there's
something broken in your spine and in your in the
in the brain stem like every time you turn your
head it almost feels like there's weird uh like electrical
signals that are being sent through your spinal column but
that they're sort of like malfiring and malfunctioning you can
feel the toxic effects of of this chemical coursing through
your brain and your heart starts beating in an irregular
fashion so it's it's obviously not healthy for you but
the only way you can know that is by first
trying it so i was trying it blind i had
no idea what it was going to be like and
there weren't any good trip reports to read about this
substance because it's it's a rare substance that almost nobody
has ever tried before so you're not going to get
reliable data on it by reading reports and and so
it felt like i poisoned myself and it was very
uncomfortable but at the same time it also did expand
my consciousness a little bit but it expanded in such
an uncomfortable and kind of twisted and dysfunctional way where
it almost felt like i was a broken human like
imagine if somebody hit you in the head with a
baseball bat not enough to kill you and not enough
to knock you unconscious but to the point where like
you're you're half [ __ ] and you're stumbling around
and you can you can turn your head and look
around and balance but you're not thinking straight your memories
aren't co coherence you're not able to strength together coherent
thoughts you're not able to use your logical mind the
way that you would normally or even the way that
you might on a on a traditional psychedelic like lsd
or mushrooms it's just it feels like your whole brain
is is misfiring and miss working and so i sat
there in this uncomfortable state for a couple hours and
i was wondering like well how long is this going
to last you know 5 meo dmt doesn't last very
long it only lasts about 60 minutes when you plug
it and dpt lasts longer it can last three to
four hours and so i was wondering well is this
thing going to last more like 60 minutes or more
like four hours because i don't want four hours of
this well sure enough it lasted like five hours uh
and so it was a kind of kind of a
miserable uncomfortable five hours or so it was it was
a lot more persistent than i had hoped but it
was mostly bad simply from a physical perspective it didn't
really take me into any kind of like madness territory
where i was losing my mind or having nightmares and
hallucinations i didn't get very much of that because it
was a small dose i'm sure if i took a
large dose of it it would but then of course
the body discomfort would have been even worse um i
was concerned a bit about how my heart was beating
in an irregular manner and about the way that my
head like every time i was turning my head it
felt like something was broken inside my my spine and
brain stem and that did concern me but also i
wasn't really panicked it wasn't like a super bad trip
i wasn't panicked i knew that it would pass so
i just kind of just sat there on the couch
resigned myself to this discomfort and told myself well this
is it's going to pass it's okay um even if
it's a little bit toxic you know it's it'll be
fine and so after about five hours it passed i
went back to normal and everything's been fine it didn't
harm my health or anything like that so but uh
that's definitely one you should not take of all the
psychedelics i've tried i highly advise you not to experiment
with five meow dpt horrible horrible chemical it just it
just feels wrong to take it at least that's how
it is for me maybe for some of you it
will work but you know i wouldn't i wouldn't risk
it stay away from that one um let's see other
bad trips that i've had oh yeah this probably brings
me to the last set of bad trips that i'll
describe which is dmt classic nndmt i'm extremely sensitive to
dmt like ridiculously ridiculously sensitive to even tiny quantities of
dmt it sends me into infinite consciousness that is so
profound that it's horrifying and shocking it it's too much
to handle really so i started experimenting with deep dmt
uh vaping it and the problem with dmt is that
it doesn't plug very well it doesn't work orally very
well without something like harmala extract that i didn't want
to eat so anyways i was vaping it and with
vaping it especially i was i was i was a
noob with the vaping process so i was just teaching
myself how to vape which is difficult because with plugging
you can put 10 milligrams into your syringe and plug
10 milligrams or 20 milligrams and you know you're getting
exactly 20 milligrams when you do that vaping is much
more imprecise especially if your technique is not really dialed
in you can vape even if you're using something like
a glass vapor genie which i've actually used i've used
what is considered to be the best pipe for vaping
dmt so i use the glass vapor genie but it's
still not that easy to use and what ends up
happening is that you you vaporize the dmt you suck
it in through this glass pipe but the sides of
the glass pipe they're cold and they conden they they
collect and condense the the vapor any vapor that touches
the glass basically attaches to the glass and crystallizes all
along the glass of the pipe and so what you're
actually sucking into your lungs is a portion of the
quantity that you put into the pipe and also you
usually don't vaporize the entire quantity but some portion of
it so it's a portion of a portion that you're
getting so you're not really sure how much you're getting
each time you take a toke of this pipe and
moreover it very much depends on how you're using your
lungs to inhale the dmt because if you take a
shallow inhale it could feel like you didn't really get
much and you can just feel threshold effects from the
same dose as if you take you know you take
the same dose but this time you inhale very deeply
like deep into your lungs and you're going to get
a powerful blast of that [ __ ] it'll you'll
get a break through those so the difference between a
threshold dose and a breakthrough dose for me sucking on
this pipe is uh it's very tricky to get that
just right and so it's easy to under do it
under do it under do it and then you say
okay [ __ ] i'm gonna put more in there
you put more in there then you take one big
hit and then you overdo it by accident so it's
hard to dial that in and you really never know
exactly how much you're sucking in every time and it
also depends how long you hold it you suck it
in and then you hold it you try to hold
it for as long as you can the longer you
hold it the more powerful it's going to be because
as soon as you exhale you're actually going to be
exhaling dmt crystals if you didn't absorb it all into
your lungs which can take 20 to 30 seconds so
as i was experimenting with all that using trial and
error you know making a bunch of mistakes um i
took a couple of really big hits of that dmt
and man it just it sends me into such a
profound state of of infinite consciousness and it's it's so
it's so loving like it's got so much love to
it especially dmt for me it's just like it's pure
love pure [ __ ] love you're you're basically inhaling
love and i inhale so much of this love that
it just it my entire visual field sort of started
twisting in on itself into four-dimensional five-dimensional shapes that are
completely mind-boggling and out of this world and it's just
it's a terrifying degree of love and so uh overall
dmd is amazing i love it but if i take
too much of it i just get pummeled by this
crippling degree of love that my body and mind can
barely contain and it it almost drives me into a
suicidal state where it's so loving and so beautiful that
it makes me want to kill myself and of course
that could be dangerous so so any time that you're
taking psychedelics and they bring you to a point where
you start getting suicidal thoughts for whatever reasons whether you're
depressed or it could be the opposite because you're so
happy and you're so loving you're so filled with love
that you don't even care if you live anymore that's
what it does to me um that's when you know
you've taken too much and you're in dangerous territory and
actually one of the most paradoxical things about love you
think of well leo how can love be bad it
sounds like you're describing a good trip like why are
you being such a [ __ ] why don't you
just accept the love and enjoy it why are you
making it so difficult well i guarantee that if you
experience these degrees of love that i'm talking about ever
in your life um it you're actually going to find
it traumatizing it's going to traumatize you imagine so much
love it's traumatic it's hard for us to imagine that
because we think that trauma has to be bad stuff
trauma can only be pain and suffering well that's usually
the case but weird things happen when you take dmt
or other psychedelics you know things turn inside out and
so yeah you can experience so much love and bliss
that it actually becomes counterproductive and it becomes painful and
you actually want it to stop because it's too much
so that was difficult and then of course there's a
lot to integrate after that it comes with many very
twisted and mind [ __ ] insights that you have
to integrate after you come back so anyways with with
dmt what i learned is be very careful with your
vaping technique like very very very careful because because also
the other problem with vaping is that vaping hits you
so hard and so fast compared to plugging or oral
administration it hits you so fast within like 30 seconds
you go from 0 to 60 in 30 seconds and
there's no way to control it you're not even going
to have time to run outside the way you would
with lsd or mushrooms you can go outside you can
go into a different room maybe you can turn on
some fun music and dance you can turn on a
youtube video some comedy and watch it and maybe you
can even find a video online of somebody talking to
you trying to talk you down from your negative thoughts
you can't do that within 30 seconds of vaping that
dmt first of all that dmt it hits your lungs
so hard that it takes you like a minute just
to recover because you you inhale it and then it's
stinging your lungs for about 30 seconds you have to
hold it for 30 seconds just to absorb it all
but that 30 seconds is already enough to to get
you to near the peak of this trip and by
the time you exhale you're already like you're so zoned
out from normal reality after those 30 seconds you're not
gonna have time to run to a different room or
to change your mood or to think different thoughts like
you are [ __ ] flying off into a different
universe and that can be terrifying and it's the rate
and speed at which it happens is so fast that
that in of itself makes it more terrifying because there's
less room there for you to maneuver to manipulate to
calm yourself down to talk yourself out of something to
even give yourself encouragement and give yourself a little pep
talk you know like ordinarily on mushrooms or lsd you
could say well i've had bad trips in the past
this is just me another one like that i can
i can stomach it and get through it and see
that already took 30 seconds just to explain that to
myself in this time i'd already be in an infinite
sort of like a dmt headspace it just the the
speed at which it happens itself can be terrifying so
anyways what i learned there is you know be very
careful with with vaping i wouldn't vape dmt if there
was a better method to take it now you can
try farmalaska ayahuasca that kind of stuff but then you
get into the problems of vomiting i don't really like
that um i've tried plugging it it doesn't really work
well plugged you need very very large dosages to plug
it so it's very wasteful of your substance you also
need to plug it alongside with something like harmala a
maui and so that's not ideal so anyways with emt
i learned to be more careful and and also honestly
i haven't done very much dmt after that because i
wouldn't say i'm traumatized by it but i am i
have a very healthy caution and respect for it like
i know how [ __ ] powerful it is so
i treat it like a bottle of nitroglycerin that's my
attitude towards cmt it's like nitroglycerin um and in general
i i recommend that attitude towards any psychedelic that you're
about to take you should have some trepidation before you
take it sometimes people say leo you know i'm about
to take a psychedelic and i have something a little
bit of anxiety is that wrong should i not take
it then so here's my thoughts on that i think
it's actually very important that you do have some pre-trip
anxiety i call it pre-trip anxiety pre-trip anxiety means that
you're about to take a psychedelic you're committed to taking
it you know you're going to take it but you're
a little nervous the reason that is because you're thinking
back to other times in the past you've taken it
and maybe you you remember some bad trips and you
remember how powerful it can be and so you have
a healthy respect for it in the same way that
if you were in the same room as a wild
lion you would be very careful in that room with
every step you took you would be very careful you'd
keep your eyes dead on that lion and you'd walk
on your tiptoes very carefully towards the door or the
window all the while looking at that lion to make
sure that you don't make any kind of wrong move
until you get out that door so that's the approach
you should take with psychedelics and you would actually be
in a state of adrenaline and anxiety with that line
in that room because you got to be able to
to jump through that window you got to be able
to haul ass out of there in case that line
starts moving towards you right you got to think really
fast and that's that's perfectly healthy in that situation what
would be dysfunctional is if you were in that room
with that line and you were just behaving normally and
chilling out as though it was all fine and dandy
that would be the dysfunction well likewise with psychedelics if
you are just like dumping scoops of psychedelics into your
pipe with reckless abandon just like a happy idiot thinking
that oh everything is fine i don't got to worry
about anything you're not nervous even a little bit that
tells me you don't understand the power of what you're
dealing with so for me even when i hold a
psychedelic in my hand the whole mood changes it it
does feel like i'm holding a bottle of nitroglycerin it's
a volatile substance if i drop this bottle it's going
to explode it's going to kill me that's my attitude
and with the psychedelic i have that same kind of
very serious attitude where it's like there's enough psychedelic in
this little bag to kill me if i take one
too many scoops of this stuff it could kill me
and so i have that respect going in and i
have a little bit of anxiety now it's not a
panic attack it's not full-blown fear and it's not a
paranoia where i start fantasizing about all the horrible [
__ ] that's about to happen to me after i
take this because if i was doing that then that
would result in a very bad trip so it's not
like that i have positive expectations so i'm in general
uh i try to hold the psychedelic as a benevolent
force or substance it's a benevolent thing that's going to
help me but at the same time i know how
powerful it is and i know that if i take
too much of it it's going to turn sour very
quickly so it's benevolent in the right dosages done in
the right ways in the right settings when it's done
very responsibly then it's benevolent and so it's like that
in the same way that if you were devoutly religious
you would go into a church and you would pray
at the altar of the church and there would be
a figure there of the virgin mary or christ or
whoever you pray to buddha or some vishnu deity or
whatever you would be praying at the altar to this
idol and you would have a almost irrational reverence for
this idol you wouldn't just sit there in front of
the the virgin mary statue if you were a true
christian and you would treat it just like any other
object you wouldn't treat it as though it was just
like a glass of water or if it was a
statue of a horse you give special importance to that
virgin mary statue you actually believe that that is like
a sacred object you don't spit on it you don't
curse in front of it you you treat it with
reverence well that's my attitude towards psychedelics and there's a
very good reason for this there's a practical reason it's
not just a fantasy in my own mind it's it
is a little bit of a fantasy and i know
it's a little bit of a fantasy that i'm sort
of putting the psychedelic on this little bit of a
sacred pedestal but i do that for a good reason
because it's extremely powerful in what it'll do to your
consciousness and it deserves that respect and as soon as
you drop that level of respect you're going to start
to use it irresponsibly and it'll bite you in the
ass so i've learned that just from experience that's what
that's what all of my bad trips have taught me
in a nutshell so there you go those are probably
the most memorable bad trips that i've had maybe i've
had a few others that are mildly bad but i've
probably even forgotten about them now i'd have to go
through all my memory banks to remember them all that
gives you a good uh sampling of what of what
this stuff is like and uh i should warn you
though that oh hold on i did forget one i
i gotta tell you about the salvia i actually have
i have a old episode on my blog which talks
about my salvia trip so i won't go into it
in too much detail but uh yeah salvia also was
uh was a very one of the most challenging trips
that i took and i took a very little i
took a threshold dose of saudi i also vaped it
vaped a threshold dose of salvia which i i don't
recommend you do salvia is a very dangerous psychedelic it's
actually a deliriant um it's so alien and so [
__ ] twisted that i took a little hit of
it just to test it out and already i felt
the power of it it was so alien it felt
like an alien force a sinister alien force was just
um taking over my entire visual field and the way
that it affected me was so weird because it only
affected half my visual field so half my visual field
you know how the the left hemisphere is cross wired
with the right arm and the right visual field and
then the the right hemisphere is cross wired with the
left visual field and the left arm you have this
kind of weird wiring in the in the human organism
so when i vaped some of this salvia for some
reason it hit one of my hemispheres more than the
others and so one of my visual field was basically
going into infinity and the other half of my visual
field was totally normal and it was going deeper and
deeper into this roiling infinity and it felt like i
was getting sucked into this hole of infinity um and
i lost i started losing all sense of of self
even at a uh like at a profound biographical level
so i couldn't even remember memories of my childhood anymore
that's how profound this degree of no self was salvia
gave me one of the deepest no-self experiences that i've
ever had and i've had no self-experiences without psychedelics i've
had them on various kinds of psychedelics but what's so
remarkable about salvia is that it just temporarily it wipes
away all sense of self to the point where you
can't even understand what it means to be human you're
sitting here you still look like a human but you
don't think of yourself as a human and you can't
even remember what it's like to be a human and
you can't even remember that you ever were a human
that's how [ __ ] weird it is and then
you even start to forget your own name you start
to forget where you came from like ordinarily you know
if i ask you where did you come from you
say well i was born on a planet in the
21st century to a mother and father in this country
i had a brother and a sister something like that
well when you smoke the salvia all that flies out
the window you can't even remember that [ __ ]
anymore and it doesn't even make sense you try to
think like brother brother what is a brother and you
start thinking about a brother i have i have a
brother and you and then the idea of having a
brother doesn't even make sense anymore it just simply doesn't
compute in your mind that can be pretty terrifying and
the idea that you're that you're located on a planet
earth in the middle of a in the middle of
a star system somewhere um this also doesn't compute anymore
in fact you can't even remember uh the building that
you're in because like you're sitting in a room and
right now you're assuming that this room is part of
a house your house wherever you are and and this
is outside in some neighborhood whatever well all of that
gets wiped away such that you're sitting in this room
you're sitting in your house you smoke this salvia but
you don't know where this room is located you don't
even know that it's a room per se that it's
part of a house you don't know what the outside
of your house looks like because that's been wiped away
because it's just called concepts and images in your mind
all that's wiped away and so you're sitting here in
this room but you're it feels so foreign to you
you don't even know that it's your room for all
you know you could be in some stranger's house at
that moment and that was just a threshold dose so
i immediately realized how powerful this [ __ ] thing
is and i was i was spooked by it pretty
good and i've never gone back since uh to try
more i don't really have a desire to to go
down that rabbit hole because it's gonna be i can
tell it's to be terrifying like you can you can
completely freak yourself out with salvia if you're not careful
so don't do it it's my advice so anyways let's
wrap up here some final thoughts on bad trips first
of all you should know that everything i've described up
up to this point is nowhere near how bad a
bad trip can get they can get way way worse
than this so don't think that this is as bad
as it gets in a sense these are mild bad
trips that i'm describing and the reason that is is
because i've been very careful and responsible and even so
i got myself into a little bit of trouble but
overall i've been very careful most people aren't this careful
they're sloppy and when you get sloppy then you can
have way worse trips than this so let that be
a warning to you the biggest thing you can do
to avoid bad trips is lower your doses treat your
substance with respect and reverence don't trip too frequently that's
actually another thing i forgot to mention is that i
did have difficulty and certain kinds of bad trips when
i was doing my 30-day 5-meow dmt retreat i did
a period where i did 5-mm dmt every single day
for 30 days i published a video about that in
the past go check that out but anyways um that
was problematic because i was doing it on a very
fixed schedule because i wanted to make sure i did
30 days in a row i wasn't even able to
complete the full 30 days i only did about 28
days because by the 28th day i was tripping without
even needing to take psychedelic i was just tripping 24
7. i couldn't even sleep i couldn't fall asleep because
in my sleep i was tripping i was tripping non-stop
there was so much fiber meal in my system so
um what started happening in maybe the last five days
of that 30-day retreat is that i was going into
such deep levels of consciousness that i was starting to
lose my sense of reality and groundedness into this what
we call consensus material reality i stopped being able to
sleep and it really felt like i was losing touch
with the world losing touch with people with humanity with
my family and i felt like there was nobody that
i could turn to for help because i was losing
touch with even the idea of somebody who could help
me at that point and it was very very challenging
but hey it was a 30-day challenge i was doing
that for a specific reason it was like a scientific
test that i was running to see you know how
far can you really push this so what i discovered
is basically that you can push it very far and
when you push it that far and you do it
too much like that you will become so ungrounded that
it can become dangerous to your life to your health
and to your sanity you will start to lose your
mind you won't be able to sleep properly and other
problems can result so another important thing you should avoid
is tripping too frequently don't be tripping on a daily
basis that's a very bad idea and a clear sign
that you're starting to misuse psychedelics give yourself plenty of
time to integrate between trips and if it takes you
three months to integrate between trips then give it three
months that's what you need so be flexible be adaptable
be fluid with how you go about it and remember
that you can try to manipulate your state if you're
in a bad mood you can turn on some happy
music listen to it that could help but ultimately don't
be too afraid of bad trips either because that in
itself will create bad trips if you're afraid of bad
trips your attitude should be if there's going to be
a difficult trip it's okay i've handled them in the
past i can handle them again as long as i'm
following protocol responsibly i'm not taking too much i know
that it's going to last for a few hours i'm
going to come out of it it's fine and basically
just give yourself a pep talk reassure yourself when you're
in the middle of a bad trip that this will
only last for a few hours it's going to pass
you're going to come back to normal because in the
worst trips your mind will try to trick you that
you're never coming back to normal and if you buy
into that trick then you will get panicky and afraid
and you might do stupid things and also as a
final warning watch yourself physically as you're taking psychedelics to
make sure that you're not being physically irresponsible what i
mean by that is that if you're taking psychedelics and
they make you lose control of your body where your
body starts doing dysfunctional or unhealthy or dangerous things and
you're not able to control it that is a clear
sign that you gotta lower your dose or take time
off or change your substance it's very important that you
retain motor control of your body and you don't lose
that so for example if you take a large dose
of dmt and then you start punching holes in the
wall of your house because you can't control yourself you're
so out of control you're filled with so much anger
or whatever that tells you that you're in dangerous territory
because when you lose control of your body which means
that you could punch somebody you could jump off a
rooftop you could run outside naked you could stick your
hand in the stove you could cut yourself with a
knife you could shoot yourself with a gun these sorts
of things if you feel like you're losing control to
the point where you cannot comfortably prevent yourself from doing
these things because you're so compulsive that if you see
a knife you feel the need to grab it and
to play with it and you can't stop yourself that
is a clear sign that you're in dangerous territory and
you need to stop or dial back because if you
keep doing that eventually something's going to go wrong and
you're going to harm yourself physically or you're going to
harm somebody else physically so those are my bad trips
if you have some of yours feel free to post
them down below or come check out the forum and
post your trip reports on the forums one of my
favorite things to do on the forum on the actualized
forum is to read y'all's trip reports some some of
the ultra's reports are very entertaining and and interesting and
even enlightening so come share those stories or if you
want to read other people's stories come come read stories
use the search function on the forum and you can
find lots of different trip reports that folks have submitted
over the years and other than that i recommend you
trip safe trip responsibly trip at moderate dosages and if
you do that then psychedelics can revolutionize your life but
if you're going to be sloppy and irresponsible and immature
then don't do psychedelics at all because you will destroy
your life i'm not kidding you will destroy your life
if you treat these things like a toy so you've
been warned you
