[Music] you I'm really excited about this topic of self-deception
because I personally think that this is the most important
topic that I have ever covered throughout all of my
episodes this is the one this is the mother topic
for me this is the one topic that spawns all
the other topics your mind is inherently self deceptive if
you are a freshman philosophy student in university one of
the first philosophers that you'll hear about and probably read
about is Rene Descartes he was a 16th century French
philosopher mathematician and scientist he amended the Cartesian coordinate system
that you use in geometry he invented analytical geometry but
he was also a pretty influential philosopher in fact probably
one of the most influential European philosophers even to this
day most of the last 400 years of philosophy in
the West has been a sort of a debate back
and forth with Descartes and that's why they talk about
it with freshman philosophy students but the reason I say
that is because see Rene Descartes did a very interesting
thing and that he began his philosophy by doubting absolutely
everything or at least that's what he claimed so he
would sit down and he would question everything he would
question sense-perception he would question the external world he would
question the existence of God he would question the existence
of himself everything absolutely everything would come under doubt under
skepticism and his idea was that he's gonna create a
philosophy that overcomes that if it's possible built on a
indubitable foundation and so one of his chief doubts is
what's called this evil diamond doubt and this is that
he imagined an evil demon who can tinker with your
brain and he can program your brain with all sorts
of ideas he can basically screw around with all your
perceptions and all your thoughts and everything so that what
you're seeing out here maybe it's just an illusion maybe
you're just in the matrix and this evil demon has
you completely under his spell so if that's the case
what can we really know and he says ah but
there's still one thing that we can know even if
we assume that there is this evil demon and that
one thing is that cogito ergo sum I think therefore
I am which really means that if I'm able to
doubt the very fact that I'm doubting means that there
has to be one who is doubting so the evil
demon can deceive me about all sorts of things but
he has to be deceiving somebody after all that's what
it means to be deceived is that you're someone who
is deceived or at least that's how we thought now
there's there's problems with that line of reasoning as you
know if you studied non duality but the point here
being is that see philosophers like to hypothesize about all
sorts of crazy and outlandish doubts like this evil demon
doubt and they will be skeptical about all sorts of
things like well maybe we know this thing but maybe
we don't know this thing maybe we're wrong about that
thing but the one thing that almost no philosopher takes
seriously is the most important thing to take seriously which
is my number one most important principle of life and
that is is that your mind is inherently a self-deception
machine its job is to produce and concoct self-deceptions we
don't need an evil demon we don't need a brain-in-a-vat
we don't need to be in a matrix or in
a computer simulated virtual reality we don't need these kind
of outlandish doubts we have a very realistic and very
plausible doubt right here the most important one which nobody
takes seriously of course of course they don't because the
whole point of self-deception is that you don't take it
seriously otherwise it wouldn't be a successful self-deception your own
mind is the evil demon that's it the extent of
this self-deception is utterly total it's hard for me to
put into words just how total it is I have
to stand up here for hundreds of hours talking about
all the nuances and intricacies of how your mind deceives
itself and in a sense that's all that actualized at
or really is and will be going forward in the
future is just me talking about every possible way in
which you deceive yourself and you going oh haha I
see oh that's that's so enlightening because that's all that
there is here to this game called life it's just
self-deception within a self-deception within a self-deception within a self-deception
and we don't need outlandish philosophical or science fiction scenarios
like the carts or you know some people don't take
the cart seriously and they say oh well it's just
that's just mere philosophy but when you say oh well
what about what if we're all living in a virtual
reality and people take that a little bit more seriously
because we've got computers now they're getting advanced there's more
virtual reality systems that are pretty lifelike these days although
this are pretty crude but they're getting better and so
you can make an argument that well you know in
in 50 years 100 years maybe we'll get there and
maybe it'll be impossible to distinguish virtual reality from real
reality and so they take that doubt seriously but they
don't take the most important doubt seriously which is that
your mind your mind has complete power over you and
it always has since the very beginning of human history
the number one biggest mistake in life is assuming that
your own mind can be trusted this is not the
case and in fact uh I started keeping a list
of these what I call laws of epistemology because what
we're talking about here is epistemology theory of knowledge how
do you know anything how do you know that what
you know is reliable and so I started coming up
with this list of laws and the number one at
the top of my list is that your own mind
is inherently self deceptive that's the first law of epistemology
your mind will use every opportunity to deceive you no
assumption of your mind can be trusted no matter how
obvious or self-evident it seems and in fact if you
think that something is self-evident or obvious or it doesn't
bother or doesn't warrant further investigation then you can be
very confident that that right there is your self-deception the
minds capacity for self-deception is total and in fact the
breadth and depth of the self-deception helps the self-deception to
remain a deception because if it was just a small
little self-deception then you'd be easy for you to spot
it and to say oh well look that's where I'm
tricking myself that's where I'm fooling myself but when it's
total when it's deep beyond your ability to comprehend and
to imagine when it would take me hundreds of hours
of talking or thousands of pages of writing on this
topic to explain it all you can see how that
actually helps the self-deception escape detection and that's precisely what
your mind is up to your mind wants to construct
a reality without you being aware that it meaning you
is constructing the reality because your mind and you are
the same thing so this is a very unique situation
the way self-deception works because you are tricking yourself you
are the very mechanism by which you come into existence
a strange loop as it was as it were now
a corollary of this law of epistemology is that you
don't need to worry about other deception meaning you don't
need to worry about other people deceiving you or tricking
you you don't need to worry about Alex Jones types
and conspiracy theorists or your boss or your government tricking
you of course all those people can trick you and
do and and will that's how reality works but the
only way that they can trick you successfully is first
if you trick yourself and in fact being worried about
other people deceiving you is itself part of the self
deception that is corrupting your own mind you see because
as long as your own mind can fabricate enemies out
there for you to fight against that's perfect because your
mind then is oriented outwardly and that means it's fighting
and chasing out they're completely distracted by all these red
herrings conspiracy theories Flattr theories you know moon landing conspiracy
theories whether kind of other conspiracy theories are popular these
days you know all of that is just a distraction
from what from realizing that you are your own greatest
conspiracy theory your entire life is one giant conspiracy theory
but of course nobody wants to look into that it's
much more entertaining for the mind to go look at
the conspiracy theory about the Flat Earth or about the
moon landing or about aliens or something like that and
I'm not saying that those things are necessarily false I'm
just saying you have to get your priorities straight those
are just baby deceptions even if all of those were
true if we actually did live on a flat earth
that would be peanuts compared to the conspiracy theory that
is you and your life what I'm talking about here
with self-deception is not just you personally bullshitting yourself here
and there I'm not just talking about a psychological level
of self-deception I'm talking about self-deception that goes all the
way to the bottom it goes of course you know
it includes all the personal self deceptions and [ __
] that that you think and you believe and all
the social and cultural [ __ ] that we believe
but it goes way deeper than that it goes beyond
psychological level beyond the sociological level to the physical level
and even beyond the physical level to the metaphysical level
it affects what you consider reality to be it affects
the very fabric and structure of reality consider how easy
it would be for your own mind to fool you
this is something that people really underestimate they don't take
this problem nearly as seriously as they ought to because
they don't think it through so let's think this through
how easy how easy would it be extremely easy once
you see everything that the mind has control over it
could construct an unbreakable illusion an illusion that would appear
indistinguishable from reality how so well consider your mind holds
all the power it renders all of your perceptions it
governs your motivations your desires and your hatreds it governs
your sleep your hunger your sex drive your need for
safety it governs your logic and your thinking it governs
your emotions it governs your sense of certainty and doubt
it governs your memories your beliefs and your narratives it
governs your interpretations it governs your judgments your criticisms it
governs what you will and won't debate and argue about
it governs your standards of evidence it governs how you
assign probabilities to various truth statements it governs what you
focus on it governs what you consider real versus illusory
and it governs even your imagination so think about all
of this stuff that your mind is in control of
I'm not merely talking about cognitive biases here generally in
psychology and within the self-help field we acknowledge that there
are self I mean the cognitive biases and there's a
list of them you can find them on Wikipedia 20
or 30 or so commonly known cognitive biases such as
confirmation bias and self-serving bias also as biases like this
and that's generally known within psychology and psychology generally agrees
that yeah your mind is pretty tricky and it can
it can deceive you to believing something but but that's
not nearly as deep as what I'm talking about that's
just at the psychological level that only scratches the surface
of the depth of this problem what I'm talking about
here is much much much deeper I'm talking about self-deception
that goes all the way to the existential level that
effects what you think you are who you are what
the world is how reality works everything it affects physics
it affects science it affects psychology affects logic it affects
everything and make sure that you understand me here that
I'm not just talking about non-duality here I'm not merely
building up to enlightenment I've talked about enlightenment enough and
quite honestly I'm bored talking about it so that's not
what I'm talking about here with self-deception self-deception is a
much broader notion than just me helping you to to
grapple with enlightenment of course that a big part of
it but that's not the only part of it your
self-deception goes way beyond merely your unenlightened and your not
knowing what you are and who you are existentially it
affects your relationships your career it affects all your emotions
it affects all your beliefs I like everything everything you
call life he's affected by this every social institution every
interaction with every human being your attitude towards every single
object that you've ever encountered so we're talking about much
more than just becoming enlightened here we're talking about like
the operating system of the human mind and all of
its functions so ever we're talking everything so notice that
let's say let's just say as a hypothetical you're in
a giant room and in this giant room there's a
curtain and there's a giant elephant behind the curtain in
fact this elephant is so giant that the curtain is
only covering a portion of the elephant's ass the elephant's
ass is so big the curtain does even cover the
whole thing so to pull back the curtain and to
look underneath and to see this elephant that would be
like overcoming yourself deception and your minds job is to
prevent you from ever pulling back that curtain and you
might think well Leo if I really want to I
can just go and pull the curtain back and just
look at the elephant no problem there it's pretty obvious
you can't hide such a huge elephant in plain sight
in the same room with me but again you're under
estimating just how much power the mind holds to see
just when you get the desire to go over there
and pull back the curtain your mind can just flip
a switch and boom your desire falls away you don't
have a desire to see the elephant anymore or you
don't even care about the curtain now you have a
desire to eat food and have sex and so you
don't care about any elephants anymore you just care about
eating insects or you tell yourself okay I can beat
this I can beat the the eating in the sex
so you're just about to go to pull across the
curtain and all of a sudden now you get very
sleepy and now you gotta go take a nap and
then after you wake up from the nap you've forgotten
all about this elephant and this curtain and in fact
your mind controls all your memories so it can easily
wipe away any memories it wants it can easily play
with those it can select which memories it wants to
remember so rather than remembering the elephant and the curtain
and this whole procedure it will get you to think
about some some other idea something you saw on TV
so your minds gonna be filled with ideas about oh
I saw this movie and I had sex with that
person and wouldn't it be nice to go to some
tropical vacation and so you have all this you're daydreaming
cuz your mind can control all your thoughts and all
your dreams it can also control all your emotions they
can control all your motivations your mind can rationalize anything
it wants to with logic in with thinking so your
mind can say something like oh well do you really
need to go and look at this elephant after all
there's probably nothing special about this elephant anyways you've seen
elephants in the zoo so what difference does it make
whether you see this often or you don't ah don't
worry about it let's go play video games and so
off you go playing video games for the next five
years do you see how much power the mind has
the mind doesn't just have psychological power it even has
physical psychosomatic power such that when you go and if
you're really adamant like no damn it I'm gonna pull
back that curtain and I'm gonna look at this elephant
and as you're pulling back that curtain your mind can
actually trigger your body to have a physical reaction it
can give you panic attack they can give you a
heart attack he can give you a toothache it can
give you a cold it can reduce your immune system
such that you catch a cold and then you're too
busy with your cold to worry about the elephant see
it has all the strings your mind is the ultimate
puppet master over you when you think you're controlling it
actually it's the one that's controlling you that's how tricky
this stuff is ask yourself can I trust my own
mind am i deceiving myself and listen carefully for the
answer what does your mind tell you oh of course
you can trust me of course why wouldn't you trust
me after all I am you I'm looking out for
you so if you can't trust me who can you
trust everything's in order here don't worry about this is
just philosophy this is just Leo and his stupid philosophy
this is just a waste of time let's go back
to living life why worry about these sorts of abstract
hypothetical philosophical considerations but who said that your mind do
you see the circularity here the whole problem is the
circularity of this it's viciously circular when I tell people
that maybe you're totally self deceived what do people do
they go inside and they check wait a minute maybe
he's right maybe I am self deceived they quickly check
and they said nah no no I'm not really self
to see other people yeah sure other people are self
to see but not me I couldn't be self deceived
after all if if I was deceived I'd know about
it but who are you asking who are you listening
to who are you trusting if we're suspicious of the
mind is it enough that we just asked the mind
hey can I trust you and then it says yes
of course you can and then we said okay good
I can trust you then is that enough to overcome
this problem no you're not grasping the depth of the
problem yet this is the same for all Elmas as
asking the fox guarding the henhouse hey if I go
on vacation are you gonna take good care of all
my chickens what's the fox gonna tell you of course
you go go enjoy your vacation yeah go play some
video games go go laugh it up go go have
a blast go have a party I'll take real good
care of your chickens and you like a fool just
believe him that's the problem here people think that like
Leo if I was deceiving myself surely I would know
it oh yeah how you might know it if you're
assuming that you are deceiving yourself in a low fidelity
way so you're assuming a low quality deception like if
some fool was trying to deceive you he would do
a piss-poor job of it and you would be able
to spot it and say aha ah there it is
that's a deception I see you but that's only with
a poor low quality deception try to up the ante
try assuming a high fidelity deception try to assume that
the thing deceiving you is way more intelligent than you
infinitely more intelligent than you imagine that this self-deception that
we're speaking of was designed by God himself with infinite
power and now you start to get a little bit
of a taste of the depth of this problem because
how can you know that you are not succumbing to
that degree of self-deception a self-deception so good that it's
literally indistinguishable from reality a degree of self-deception so total
that there is nothing to compare it against such that
it feels completely real completely objective you see the first
rule of successfully deceiving yourself is to tell yourself that
self-deception isn't a big problem and that if I was
self deceived I would easily know about it and I
would easily overcome it and so therefore there's nothing really
to worry about that's how it begins that's how this
whole thing begins that's like the kernel of this massive
tree of self-deception that arises up out of your mind
it starts with that little seed with you believing that
self-deception isn't really a thing at least not for me
yeah other people of course to see themselves but not
me I'm smarter than those people I'm not a fool
I'm not self-deluded like those religious nuts or those cults
or those political leaders or those crazy people I'm not
like that I'm different I'm intelligent I'm good at detecting
my own self deceptions because I'm reasonable because I'm scientific
because I'm rational because I'm logical or whatever other things
you tell yourself that right there is where it all
begins and then from that thousand other self-deceptions sprout you
see the mind needs to tell itself this first thing
because if it can get away with that look it
can get away with almost anything because once you don't
take self-deception seriously that means your own mind can just
fabricate whatever it basically wants and you're gonna believe it
and you're not gonna question it and you're not gonna
self reflect to ask hey wait a minute did I
construct this myself am i bullshitting myself you're not gonna
check because you've already bought into the idea that you
don't [ __ ] yourself because well you're just not
taking this very seriously you're thinking of this as a
philosophical problem as some abstraction something disconnected from your actual
life but what if that's not the case what if
what I'm talking about here is not a science fiction
fantasy but this is the chief thing that you must
worry about in life could that possibly be the case
see this right here is true skepticism not the phony
kind of skepticism where people point fingers at other people
say oh you're full of [ __ ] and you're
full of [ __ ] that's easy to do it's
easy to point to others and to say that they're
full of [ __ ] the question is can you
point the finger back at yourself and really investigate the
source of your own [ __ ] the mind has
co-opted all of the tools that I talked about above
all the the strings that it has it controls your
emotions and your thoughts and your judgment and your memories
and your perceptions everything it's co-opted all of those to
serve you in a way it's doing you a favor
it's serving you but the problem is that when it
serves you it's not serving the truth and so we
see that there's this fundamental disconnect between serving the self
which is the entire process of life being alive to
be alive means serving yourself all the time to keep
yourself alive against the forces of nature which are hell-bent
on destroying you versus the truth and perhaps the truth
has nothing to do with you staying alive and maybe
in fact these things are antagonistic and maybe they actually
go against each other maybe there's sort of a tug-of-war
between the two now you might say but leo why
would my own mind be so tricky why would it
need to deceive me it must have a good reason
right otherwise what you're talking about here well you just
can't take it seriously just sounds a little bit outlandish
and a little bit abstract well yes it sounds outlandish
and abstract if you take existence for granted if you
take objective reality for granted if you assume that there
is such a thing as existence and objective reality and
that stuff just exists and just is the way that
you think that it is then yeah sure why would
the my need to deceive you but what if we
consider a different alternative what if nothing really exists what
if everything is relative what is what if perspective defines
reality what if exists the self is predicated on fabrication
and deception after all this is the entire problem of
reality in a nutshell how does something come out of
nothing where did it all come from why is it
here how did it get here how is creation possible
at all well most people take this completely free ranted
but if you just go along with me here and
consider this other alternative consider the alternative that actually there's
nothing and after things to come into being they can
only come into being through one mechanism deception deception isn't
just something you do to trick other people or to
trick yourself deception start to think of this as not
a psychological mechanism but an actual physical mechanism or a
metaphysical mechanism it's the mechanism of creation how does God
create the world not by arranging a bunch of atoms
and molecules not like that God does it through deception
through self-deception now you might wonder well Leo why would
God need to deceive himself well think about it how
does God come into being and if there is only
one thing which is reality or the universe because reality
to catch-all term for everything which includes everything including God
then God couldn't be separate from reality itself so if
there's just one thing how does that one thing differentiate
itself into a billion trillion infinite number of other things
by tricking itself into thinking that it's not one thing
but that is a individual thing that it's not the
whole but that it's the part and so through deception
God creates infinite form including you and me that's the
trick that's the magic trick it's really the only way
God could create everything including himself and it has to
be a self-deception notice it's not that God is deceiving
you is that God is deceiving itself because there is
no you and God that would be two things there's
only one thing this one thing can take on many
forms only by tricking itself into thinking that it's limited
that it's finite rather than infinite and so through this
process deception literally becomes the mechanism of creation and it
must be self-deception notice God can't deceive someone else because
God is all there is because one thing is all
there is reality is all there is reality can't deceive
something outside of itself reality must deceive itself to come
into existence so what we're talking about here is is
not just psychological stuff we're talking about how the entire
universe came into being how you came into being and
of course we're not just talking about how you came
into being but we're also talking about how you live
your life and why you live your life the way
you do because when your entire sense of being is
predicated upon deception then of course your entire attitude towards
reality is pretty is is based on deception and therefore
that's how you live you self deceive every single day
there are big self deceptions and little self deceptions one
self deception within another within another within another it's a
giant nest of self-deception in a sense that's what you
are your whole body and mind and everything is just
built out of self-deception that's like the material of which
you are made at least that's what you get if
you stop assuming that reality is objective-c because if you
assume there is such a thing as objective reality then
none of this makes sense you don't need any of
this but when you stop assuming that then all the
sudden this very interesting new possibility opens up to you
it's that self-deception is much more powerful of a force
than you ever assumed it wasn't just about lying or
cheating a little bit here and there manipulating someone over
there you know pulling someone over pulling something over on
someone over here it's not just this little stuff it's
it's much more than that you're actually changing reality itself
with your self deceptions that's how powerful this could be
and of course the greatest self-deception is that you are
real important and must survive that's the mother self-deception that's
you literally you are the chief self-deception and then all
the other self deceptions are built upon that because hey
without a self there is nothing to deceive without a
self there's nothing to do without a self there's no
one to care so of course if the mind was
trying to deceive you and the only way you came
into existence is through a deception then what's the last
thing that you're willing to admit is a self-deception the
self which is precisely the problem that Rene Descartes ran
into he doubted everything but he couldn't doubt the self
and that's because he had too limited of imagination he
was looking too far into some outlandish theory about evil
demons and you know there's no evil demons we don't
need evil demons all we need is we need the
mind the mind does it all and we need a
good reason for why the mind needs to do it
and that reason is existence creation how does creation happen
how does something come out of nothing this is it
this is the mechanism and then on top of that
is built the entire web of lies that is the
rest of your life consider the possibility that lying is
actually much more useful than truth in many situations we
like to tell truth as something Noble and idealistic and
something to aspire to but what most people don't understand
is that really they only like truth in name the
only like truth so long as they think it's serving
them and of course to pull off a successful self-deception
what does my need to do the mind needs to
get a hold on this notion of truth ideally if
you really want to deceive yourself what you would do
is you would flip truth and falsehood completely around such
that what was false you would call truth and what
was truth you would call false and so you would
actually make a big show of loving truth you would
be a lover of truth a defender a Crusader of
truth when in fact the thing that you call truth
is actually falsehood you see how this works the mind
just flips everything on its head why do people lie
to get what they want it's because they're pressured they're
put into a corner and they could be advantaged if
they lie in that situation to save themselves to earn
more money to have more sex to get a little
bit more pleasure to save a few dollars here or
there that sort of stuff that's why you lie because
it serves you the mind lies because that's what you
need to stay alive and after all if you're not
alive then what is there there's nothing see see it's
the sort of self-fulfilling prophecy it generates its own meaning
life generates its own meaning this way just by the
fact that you are alive you need to stay alive
and therefore all of life becomes meaningful now at least
there's an illusion of meaning because now there's this cycle
of staying alive because as soon as that cycle stops
well all of a sudden you know if you're dead
you don't have the ability to worry about being alive
or not or anything else so as long as you
are alive all your attention goes on staying alive but
what if there's something beyond living something beyond staying alive
we'll see most people they never access that because they're
so preoccupied with just being pragmatic and just living and
that's why people dismiss philosophy and self-help and spirituality and
just say oh well that's all just airy-fairy stuff let's
just get down to earth let's just be scientific let's
just be concrete let's not talk about all this sort
of you know speculative stuff after life death and life
and I mean who really knows leo this is just
all philosophy let's just be pragmatic what I know is
that when I'm hungry I want to eat and what
I know is that when I'm horny I wanna have
sex and what I know is that money gets me
freedom and what I know is that if I have
a good job then that's happy that makes me happy
and if I have a good family that makes me
happy that's what I know that's real down earth stuff
that's how most people think or maybe that's just part
of a larger lie the lie of being alive see
the problem with lies is that they always backfire they
only work in the short-term they're never sustainable so people
who are hyper pragmatic and want to live very pragmatically
it might seem like that's a good strategy at first
because you're avoiding all this mental masturbation but are you
really or are you just gonna drown slowly in all
of your own lies and self-deceptions as you're living this
pragmatic lifestyle of course you are and then what that's
gonna lead to is ultimately depression lack of fulfillment frustration
emotional problems neuroses all that stuff because all that stuff
is linked to all your self-deception and just the fact
that you're denying that you're pragmatic way of living is
untenable and ultimately unsustainable well just because you deny that
well that's just more more of yourself deception you can
deny it all day long but you're gonna suffer for
it because you're fundamentally disconnected from reality from truth see
your minds job is to keep you alive and I
don't just mean to keep you alive physically in fact
primarily your minds job is not to keep your body
alive the way that people think but to keep the
idea of you alive people think that the body is
more fundamental than the idea of you because they think
that the idea of you resides in the body no
the idea of you is far more fundamental than your
body all sorts of stuff can happen to your body
but what the mind really cares about is the idea
of you and preserving that at all costs preserving your
self-image which is precisely why you can find examples throughout
history and different cultures where people abuse and mutilate their
own bodies do all sorts of stuff to their bodies
which are physically painful and even harmful and counterproductive to
physical survival make you no physical survival harder but yet
they play into the self image the idea of them
because really the body is just another part of the
idea of you because what you are is not a
body but this conglomeration of conceptual ideas which is why
people become martyrs you might think like oh I becoming
a martyr that's such a selfless act no it's not
becoming a martyr for most people is a very selfish
act because actually the reason they become a martyr is
because they have some idea of them that martyr ship
plays into so they see themselves as being a modern
how they will live on in the memories of their
followers and their fans in the history books and maybe
in some afterlife they will live on as the idea
of them being a martyr and that to them is
more precious than actually remaining physically alive so they will
go and martyr themselves for that and they will do
it happily because it's not about the body survival is
about surviving the idea of you make sure that you
understand that I'm not merely talking about enlightenment here yes
of course we're talking about enlightenment but that's just like
the most obvious example and actually in a sense this
itself is sort of a red herring because as you're
focused only on enlightenment you're not hearing all the other
things that self-deception is applying to in your own life
and I'll point out some of those to you after
a quick intermission so I'm gonna take a little break
you don't go anywhere and I'll be back notice that
most of the things that you love in life are
self-deceptions here's a quick list money and wealth ownership security
laws and rights history movies love porn time language religion
science good and bad fame power confidence meaning and purpose
ideologies of all stripes family corporations Nations equality rank status
friendships culture videogames what is all of this but self-deception
let's pick out a few of these and talk about
them so for example ownership the concept of ownership is
the most absurd self-deception ever you actually believe that you
own your dog that you own your house you will
actually pull out a certificate of title that you own
your house or you own your car and you'll point
to this piece of paper as though it means that
you own something as if ownership is actually possible as
if it's possible within reality for one piece of reality
to own some other piece of reality it's complete absurdity
and yet we take ownership so seriously how about security
security and power this one's very interesting people think they
have security they buy a lot of guns that's popular
these days people buy an arsenal of 2030 guns because
they want to feel secure and they want to feel
powerful and they think that this this leo this surely
this is not some abstraction this is tangible power and
military dictators and rulers and governments they have mass power
they have tanks and they have nuclear weapons and they
think that this is power this is tangible this is
a complete self-deception there's no such thing as security all
of us are going to die all of us are
going to end up in exactly the same place there's
no security to be had you can't predict what's really
gonna happen to you and in fact the more power
you think you acquire the more insecure you become you
know who the most insecure people the dictators the people
with the biggest Arsenal's that's why they have the biggest
Arsenal's to begin with is because they're insecure because they
think someone's gonna take them out and they can't go
to bed to sleep at night because they're worried someone's
gonna stab in the back they can't eat their feet
their favorite food because they're worried something's gonna poison their
food take a look at Donald Trump in the news
that came out recently that he at heats at McDonald's
why is he at McDonald's because he's worried that someone's
gonna poison his food you see it's insecurity it's all
insecurity all power is based upon insecurity it's a complete
self-deception you think you're gonna get more powerful by amassing
more guns or something no you're just very insecure and
you're fooling yourself because no matter how many military planes
you have or how many bombers you have or how
many nuclear weapons you have you've still got to worry
about someone taking you out you got to worry about
a COO look of Vladimir Putin he has arguably the
largest wealth of anyone in the world he's estimated to
be one of the richest people in the world over
two hundred billion dollars in private wealth and he's got
a pretty powerful army and all that and he's got
a pretty strong stranglehold over the government Russia but then
again this guy has to be extremely insecure because he
knows that if he takes his eye off the ball
even for a minute somebody else is gonna come in
and take all his power lock him in jail seize
all his funds so he's got to keep an iron
fist on that thing otherwise he's all gonna unravel and
of course that's how it always is and in the
end it always ends up unraveling the only question is
will will he be alive for the unraveling how about
laws and rights Human Rights moral rights legal laws or
entire legal systems is all based on self-deception there's no
rounding these laws but human consensus there's no such thing
as human rights this is an invention to make you
feel more secure because see it's all about self survival
and because you want to survive and feel secure you
invent or we as a collective society invent this notion
of human rights there's no such thing we just came
up with it we invented the whole thing and yet
we've convinced ourselves that this stuff is actually real how
about movies what are your favorite movies you like star
wars you like Lord of the Rings what do you
like you like TV shows Game of Thrones what do
you like it's all fiction it's all deception you're sitting
there watching pixels on a screen believing tricking yourself into
thinking that this is actually real you get sucked in
for a few hours and then you come back out
and you say oh man that was an amazing self-deception
of course you don't tell yourself that but that's basically
what's happening is the self-deception how about novels fiction novels
same thing how about porn same thing you're sitting there
drinking off two pixels on a screen convincing yourself that
this is real tricking your body and your mind using
your imagination and it's just a virtual simulation it's a
self-deception you're literally jerking off to pixels of light how
about science oh man is that a can of worms
full of self-deception it's all I need to shoot a
whole separate episode just about the sub deceptions of science
so we'll skip that for now how about Fame talk
about self-deception what is fame fame has no substance to
it ask yourself what fame is this idea that somehow
you have more value than other people and somehow you're
more important and that just because people like you and
because people can recognize your face on the street or
on a magazine somewhere that somehow this adds to your
value into your satisfaction and to your enjoyment of life
subserved it's a complete fiction how about confidence confidence is
just all a con game it's all self-deception to be
confident you just have to deceive yourself that you're gonna
succeed in it you're gonna you're gonna do it you're
gonna make it how about family oh man even family
is a complete self-deception think of what family really is
you have actually convinced yourself that there is some kind
of special connection between you and those other few human
beings which you selected out based on some kind of
genetic similarity based on DNA do you think that there's
some sort of special connection there and then you got
to treat them in some special way rather than the
way that you treat all other human beings or even
the way that you treat a coffee table there is
no more connection between you and your mother than there
is between you and a coffee table it's all one
thing it's all that of the exact same substance there's
nothing special about your family that's just an illusion that
the mind creates because your family is a very big
and important component of your ability to survive how about
Nations and corporations what are these but fictitious entities you
think you're American you think you're Japanese you think you're
Australian you think you're Norwegian you think you're German you
think you're African all these what are these these are
these are just completely fabricated identities completely fabric even the
very country itself the border of the country is just
an imaginary line that someone sitting in a room drafted
up how about equality you think equality is real do
you value equality and fairness and egalitarian ISM and democracy
these are all self-deceptions there's nothing equal about reality reality
just is what it is and then you try to
equalize well that's your thing that's your agenda the reason
you want equality is so you get to live a
better life for yourself that's part of your pragmatic agenda
of course I shouldn't need to tell you how rank
and status social status military status any kind of titles
that you get all of this is just self-deception and
of course culture culture is self-deception everything about culture is
self-deception and video games you like video games what is
that you're sitting there at a TV screen playing some
game for 10 hours some RPG you're so engrossed in
this virtual world that you believe you're actually inhabiting it
that you're inside of it you're failing to distinguish between
the virtual and the real and of course the more
real it looks the better it feels to you because
that just heightens the depth of the self-deception which is
why video games are having bigger and bigger budgets ballooning
budgets cost more and more hundreds of millions of dollars
to create because everyone wants photorealistic graphics which drives the
whole market why because that deepens the illusion everything in
life is about deepening the illusion and so that's what's
happening in all of these categories so we're not merely
talking about enlightenment here I want you to see that
this this notion of self-deception is is just so broad
it's so broad and it's so deep you could spend
years studying self-deception in each one of these categories and
there will be some valuable stuff for you to discover
there so also it's important to point out that even
the sources of knowledge that you would think are actually
aligned with truth are also really just serving the pragmatic
survival agenda and they are thoroughly corrupted by self-deception so
science logic and mathematics are corrupted by self-deception so is
philosophy psychology and medicine and history and government and economics
and business and marketing and even personal development and of
course religion and spirituality and of course of course non
duality the very process of talking about self-deceptions is itself
riddled with self-deceptions because that's what's needed to pull off
a successful self-deception you see the mind has to cover
its own tracks it has to fudge its own loose
ends so you can't see how the magic trick is
made that's precisely what makes it such a compelling magic
trick if you see how the magic trick is happening
that Rob's it of its magic so in a sense
you want reality to trick you that's what creates all
these illusions that's why you can sit there playing a
video game and actually think that it's real that's why
you can sit there jerking off to porn and think
that it's real you actually want that deception you don't
want the truth that would ruin your jerk-off session if
always in the back of your mind you kept telling
yourself I'm a man but these are just pixels on
a screen that would ruin the fun same thing with
playing a video game or reading a novel those are
just letters on a page you don't want to know
that you want to be wrapped up in the story
in the illusion and knowledge itself is part of the
self-deception it has to be you see because knowledge is
a dangerous thing because there's really two types of knowledge
there's your ordinary conventional knowledge which is all the stuff
they teach you in school in university on your job
and other places like that and that that knowledge is
not too dangerous the mine doesn't care about that knowledge
generally lets you get away with that but what the
mind really does care about is it cares about self
knowledge it cares about meta knowledge knowledge about the very
mechanism of how knowledge works otherwise known as epistemology it
really cares about that so see the mind is extremely
careful to withhold all meta knowledge from you such that
you use knowledge to grasp onto content out in the
world so you can have knowledge of computer programming you
can have knowledge of of some government thing you could
have knowledge of some way to cook a recipe so
this is just all harmless knowledge but the real knowledge
is the knowledge of how you're acquiring this knowledge and
why you're doing all that that's what I call meta
knowledge that's the mechanism of knowledge itself that's self reflective
awareness and that's what the mind really withholds from you
and that's what society with holds from you and if
you wonder like well Leo why don't they teach this
self actualization stuff in school in university why doesn't the
government run programs and free courses and educate everybody about
this stuff because the government is part of the self-deception
society itself is one collective self-deception we've come together and
agreed to deceive ourselves for our own self survival that's
what society is and of course it's not going to
tell you that because the whole point of it is
that you don't know that's what makes the self-deception so
successful because it's so total you look at your neighbors
you look at your co-workers you look at another country
and you see all everybody is doing the same thing
I'm doing oh that means how what I'm doing must
be true because the whole the whole way that you
get a very successful self-deception is that you leave no
or no alternatives to consider and then you also [
__ ] the the minds imagination such that the mind
is not able to imagine the alternatives it's very much
like being in North Korea they're so brainwashed as a
society in North Korea that they don't even know what
it might be like to live in any other kind
of government any other kind of country they don't even
have an idea of what true democracy might look like
even a corrupt one like the u.s. democracy it's a
very corrupt democracy but uh you know it's uh it's
not perfect but it's but a lot better than North
Korea but you know they don't even know that that's
not they can't even imagine that because their imaginations are
crippled from birth because that's how they get you they
get you from birth they indoctrinate you from birth ah
sort of for your own benefit because the truth it's
a scary thing do you really want to know the
truth well be careful about that you say you do
but do you really what if the truth is difficult
to stomach a lot more difficult than you ever thought
let's talk about some of the evidence for self-deception how
do you know that what I'm telling you here is
not just philosophy but that it's real that I'm not
bullshitting you well I'll give you five important points exhibit
a is your own lying and your own double standards
so if you turn inwards and you self reflect you
should start to notice that you deceive yourself a lot
you rationalize all sorts of silly things to yourself you
rationalize all sorts of selfish and evil ways that you
have all your manipulative behaviors all your own lying you
have all these double standards you criticize all these people
and all these ideologies and all these teachings for all
sorts of reasons but then do you apply those same
criteria to yourself of course not and if you're very
careful you should start to notice this and that's actually
something I'll talk specifically about in future episodes because it's
has a very very deep topic so hopefully as you've
been doing self-actualization work conscious work meditation and this sort
of stuff self inquiry you've been noticing this and you've
been catching yourself and that's how it happens you catch
yourself you catch yourself having these double standards like someone
cuts you off in traffic today and you get pissed
off and then next month you accidentally cut off someone
else in traffic and do you criticize yourself do you
get pissed off at yourself of course not you let
yourself slide and maybe the first ten times that happens
in your life you don't notice it but then on
the 11th time it's like wait a minute why do
I get pissed off at that person but I don't
get pissed off at myself for doing the very same
thing oh is there a double standard there am I
really serving true there am i serving myself here with
all my emotions and all my thoughts and all my
rationalizations for why that person is such an evil and
bad person for cutting me off but then I don't
think of myself that way so that's Exhibit A that
should start to clue you in on to self-deception that's
seeing it personally within yourself Exhibit B is have you
noticed that people in the world believe lots of crazy
stuff hopefully you have but see a lot of people
notice this but they don't see the significance of it
they don't see it as a sign of self-deception they
think of it as oh yeah well those peas are
just crazy and those people just right-wing nuts and those
are just left wing nuts and those are radicals over
there and those are just communists over there and those
are just some cult leaders over there and those are
some conspiracy theorists over there and yeah they all believe
all sorts of crazy stuff but you know I'm just
like a normal person and so those people are just
crazy you just explained it away by saying it's crazy
no what you're really saying there is you're saying that
all of those people are deluded or self deceived but
also at the same time notice what you're saying you're
saying that everyone else billions of other people are self
deceived but of course you're the exception you're not self
deceived how self-serving is that but notice the the irony
of this sort of logic because if you truly believe
that billions of people around the world are self deceived
like religious people are self deceived or maybe you think
atheists are self deceived of which there are millions or
you think some you know people who subscribe to some
kind of political ideology or capitalist or communist ideology they're
all self deceived of which there are millions then what
you're actually noticing there is you're noticing a very important
fact about the human mind you're noticing that the human
mind is very prone to self-deception and delusion the only
problem is that you're not taking the lesson all the
way you're noticing it in others but you're not noticing
it in yourself the deep irony is that if you
truly believe that billions of people around you are so
self deceived as to believe all this crazy [ __
] you should be very concerned that your own mind
is doing the same thing to you after all there's
no fundamental difference between you and all those other people
there's a lot more similarity than difference so that to
you is a very big clue I don't know about
you personally but for me when I see a really
deluded person on TV or something I immediately turn back
on myself and then goddamn that could be me how
am i doing all of that to myself that's the
kind of step that you got to take this extra
step of turning it inwards self reflecting which most people
don't do don't worry about other people being self deceived
worry about yourself being self deceived see when you start
to worry about others you try to cure and fix
others watch out that in itself is a self-deception because
as you're focusing outward you're not focusing inward and therefore
your mind has accomplished its objective it's distracted you your
minds job is to distract you from ever self-reflecting because
if you ever do well that might lead to the
unraveling of your entire life and we wouldn't want that
would we that wouldn't be in your self-interest Exhibit C
as evidence for self-deception is all the disagreement that exists
between people so much disagreement so much arguing and debating
have you noticed this every single group of human beings
argues and debates endlessly every ideological system every scientific system
philosophical system psychological system every religious system arrey every mystical
system every non dual school every single one of them
argues and debates endlessly with each other always disagreeing about
reality why is that have you wondered that's not just
a little byproduct that is a that is a core
feature of reality that tells you something very important about
reality the whole dynamic of an argument or a debate
what is that that is just utter self-deception here's what
it really is person a and person B person a
holds one belief person B holds the exact opposite belief
now they're gonna argue with each other person a is
self-deceived person B is also self-deceived but of course since
neither one of them wants to really turn inwards and
reflect about their self-deception what they do is they stage
an argument or a debate so here's what a debate
is about person a will point out all the self
deceptions of person B to person B meanwhile ignoring his
own self deceptions person B will do the exact same
thing in Reverse he will point out all the self
deceptions of person a while ignoring all of his own
self deceptions and so they will bake her back and
forth and each one will accuse each other of being
a bullshitter without recognizing that they themselves are the bullshitters
bullshitting to themselves and so they will do this indefinitely
and they will get very emotional about it why do
they get emotional about it why are debates heated because
there's something much deeper at stake what's deeper at stake
is recognizing and noticing your own self-deception and the danger
of being in a debate is that you might catch
a glimpse of your own hypocrisy your own double standards
and your own self bias and of course you wouldn't
want that would you so because of this you project
all of your own double standards and lying in self
bias as your project app onto your enemy and then
he does the same thing to you and now you're
just gonna argue back and forth pointing fingers at each
other neither one actually taking responsibility for what's really going
on in the inside both of them blind to the
meta mechanism of what's going on debating minutiae rather than
really getting to the heart of the issue which is
self-deception Exhibit D as evidence of self-deception is the way
that human beings treat evil and the way that you
think of other people is being evil have you noticed
this very interesting phenomena you see us throughout history one
nation or group of people thinks that some other group
of people is evil and then that group of people
thinks that the other people are evil so both think
that each that the other is evil and so what
they'll do is they'll call each other evil and they're
really believed if the other people aren't evil and then
they will use this to justify all sorts of attacks
on each other and of course this happens collectively it
happens individually like maybe your spouse thinks that there's some
co-worker who is their enemy who's trying to sabotage them
and therefore they are evil and then that co-worker Mitel
might think the the exact mirror opposite of that see
and then they become enemies with each other and they
both think of themselves as actually being evil this whole
notion of evil where does this come from this is
a notion invented by the human mind to advance its
self agenda and why do people call other people evil
precisely because it's an externalization of the evil that's within
them what is evil evil is just selfishness that's what
it is and of course you are thoroughly evil thoroughly
selfish that's what life is about life is about being
evil if you weren't evil you couldn't be alive you
would be dead but of course you don't like to
look at the reality of life and what it takes
to survive you do all of this evil [ __
] to survive and yet you deny it and you
like to tell the whole world that you're this good
upstanding moral person and that you are different than all
those other evil people out there that you're above everybody
else but in fact you're the most evil [ __
] there is everybody is just as evil as you
are but of course to deny that what you do
is you project that out and you call the terrorists
evil Nazis evil those people evil that thing evil everything
is evil except yourself have you noticed this this tendency
to want to call other things evil everyone is called
evil but you why is that because the whole notion
of evil the whole point of the concept of evil
is precisely so that you can use it to label
someone else's evil and once you've labeled them as evil
then you can just trample over them with your self
agenda you don't need to be compassionate or considerate about
their agenda you can just be selfish towards them you
can annihilate them evil gives you that excuse which is
why people are so adamant about this notion of evil
and they insist that Noah leo evil is objective it's
absurd the Nazis really are evil the only reason the
Nazis are evil to you is because they threaten you
they threaten your agenda that's the fact that's the harsh
truth have you noticed how this evil thing works it's
ironic and funny to notice that in other people between
two nations for example that are not your nation but
when your own nations involved when your own families involved
when your own self is involved you're not gonna notice
it you're not gonna notice it because it's gonna be
part of the whole self-deception you're gonna be thoroughly deceived
by this evil and you're gonna actually believe that those
people over there are really evil of course you will
because that's the minds job is to be an advocate
and attorney on your behalf damn the truth the mind
doesn't care what the truth is the minds job is
to keep you alive and there's nothing wrong with that
per se I'm not saying that's wrong I'm not saying
you should stop I'm just saying that's what it is
that's what it means to be alive and it's helpful
to start to become honest about that rather than lying
to yourself about it and Exhibit E as far as
evidence for self-deception is the history of science philosophy and
religion as a whole the history of human civilization as
a whole have you looked at this what is this
I hope you are a student of history and I
hope you've noticed by studying history that the overarching theme
of human history is one group of people behaving like
barbarians towards another group of people wonder of people believing
crazy ridiculous delusional ideas and then the next generation of
people come along and they look back at those people
and say oh look how advanced we are relative to
those people we've overcome all their obvious barbarity and self
delusions and that we are no longer prone to self
delusion because after all Leo we live in a 21st
century we've got modern science we've got physics we've sent
satellites into space we've sent men to the moon and
so now we've figured most of the stuff out sure
there's little details we don't know yet but most of
it we know and so of course we are so
much advanced then scientists or philosophers or theologians of a
thousand years ago but what is that but just more
self-deception every generation says that every generation thinks that it's
immune to the self-deceptions of the previous generation and of
course usually the new generation does escape some of the
old self-deceptions but only to run into a new set
of deceptions an even deeper set of self-deceptions because as
you mount all this evidence of all these prior generations
and all this progress that makes you think that now
you're finally at the top finally we've progressed to this
point of perfection and infallibility and true knowledge and truth
and real understanding but that's just the self-deception deepening deepening
and deepening that's what that is so study all those
and you'll get all your evidence you'll start to collect
the evidence once you start to look for it start
to look for self-deception everywhere around you but be careful
not to get too distracted by pointing it out in
other people because it's very easy to see some perception
in other people it's very easy to turn on the
TV and to watch Trump and to see this man
completely and utterly wrapped up in his own self-deception and
not know it super easy the question is can you
do that with yourself cuz you're probably not as blatant
about it as Trump is can you see that Trump
is completely blind to his own self deceptions of course
but that's not just Trump I mean Trump is a
is a particularly egregious case of it and it's great
to point to him and I actually like him having
having him as an example because it's just it's so
easy it's so blatant basically what Trump represents is he
represents the exact opposite of everything that actualized org is
about so if you want to learn how to have
the best life possible do everything that's the exact opposite
of what Trump does and a self actualization a nutshell
so in that sense is very easy it's a very
good example but also it's it's kind of misleading because
you know he's so egregious that is it's tempting to
say oh well he's just an exception and he's just
like a cartoon character and then you think that he's
somehow different from you no no no no no when
you're sitting there judging him just in that very act
you are falling prey to the very self-deception that you
are judging within him which you're not seeing within yourself
that's what judgment is it's the self-deception and that's just
the tip of the iceberg it goes much much deeper
this problem of self-deception is not a problem of a
lack of intelligence or a reason because see some people
get really tricky here and they some say something like
oh well yeah Lee of course of course most people
are deluded but I'm different I'm a very rational reasonable
person I'm sort of like a Sam Harris I think
everything through very logically methodically in this spock-like manner and
everything is very clear in my mind and I'm very
intelligent and I have a PhD or I'm an academic
or I write books or I'm a professor or something
like this and therefore I'm immune to this problem no
don't you see that reason itself is the chief tool
of self-deception the mind has co-opted reason first and foremost
reasons are used to justify yourself agenda reason doesn't get
you to truth why do you trust reason why would
you trust it ask yourself how do you know that
reason that reason is is trustworthy what are you listening
to your own mind how do you know your mind
is right just because you believe it you take it
on blind faith there can be no reason without blind
faith that's the irony reason reasonable people and the reason
that reasonable people and rationalists they like to argue and
fight and wage Crusades against people who are faith-based is
precisely because they are ignorant of the very faith that
grounds their reason the hypocrisy the irony of it is
is just absurd it's absurd which is plenty why they
have to project out they have to go and wage
a crusade and a campaign against everyone who is unreasonable
because what they're not doing is they're not turning inwards
and realizing that reason itself is based on faith and
that it itself collapses and Edith eats its own tail
this problem is much deeper than reason or intelligence that's
not gonna solve it this is a problem of conflict
of interest this is a problem of lack of self
honesty this is a problem of self bias and reason
will not solve this reason actually will only make this
worse this problem is emotional and pragmatic not logical you
can't just think your way out of this problem it's
not like the way that scientists assume that you can
just sort of investigate your own psyche in the same
way that you can investigate lab rats in a maze
like you take a lab rat you can dissect him
very objectively you're just sitting there dissecting a rat it's
just a rat you know there's no problem cutting it
open and and looking at its guts and doing this
some sort of objective analysis on a rat no no
this problem here is much more personal that's what makes
us so difficult it's a personal investigation it's very much
like if you were a lab rat doing the investigation
on yourself so imagine that you're a lab rat that
has to dissect itself with no anesthetics so you have
to take that scalpel and cut your own stomach open
and muck around in your own guts now you start
to see the real problem it has nothing to do
with objectivity there's no such thing as subjectivity here it
has nothing to do with logic it has everything to
do with emotions and your own deep personal investment in
life you see your very life is at stake here
in this investigation this is not an intellectual philosophical abstract
investigation that we're doing here when we're talking about accessing
the truth for ourselves we're talking about subjecting ourselves to
intense suffering merely from the process of looking at the
truth the truth is so blinding and bright that it
actually Sears itself into your eyes and into your flesh
when you look upon it you really cannot handle the
fallout of full self honesty if you were fully 100%
self honest with yourself right now if I was able
to just magically snap my fingers and all your self
deceptions would be revealed to you you would actually faint
and collapse to the floor with a panic attack that's
how emotional this thing would be you would be in
shock you would be convulsing on the floor foaming at
the mouth and how much you've been lying to yourself
manipulating yourself how evil you are how deluded you are
how foolish you are everything you see and Trump all
the foolishness and Trump you would see all of that
times a thousand within yourself it's just that there are
these subtle layers layer upon layer which are masking that
from your awareness right now and this process is slowly
a process of peeling back the layers and this is
a very threatening process this threatens your very survival your
very existence is at stake which actually reminds me of
a story I traveled to a different country for a
meditation retreat and sort of a consciousness workshop there that
I did and this was a very remote location up
high in the mountains in the jungle it took about
a three-hour drive to get up there and I didn't
have a car so I was hitching a ride with
another participant who was a veteran of these workshops and
he was going there pretty often because he lived in
that area he was a local so he was driving
me up there and as we were driving we were
just talking about spirituality and personal development and all this
and so I asked me know how did you find
out about this and yada yada yada and then he
says oh yeah you know I just kind of randomly
bumped into this whole spirituality do you think and before
that he didn't know anything you know about personal development
psychology self-help self actualization no I knew well he didn't
know anything about this stuff he just kind of like
stumbled into this you know blindly and so he drove
up there one time by himself a while back and
this was his first time and the Guru or the
teacher dropped some deep truth on him and started to
talk about non-duality and the ego and the mind and
self-deception all this stuff that we talked about with self-actualization
and non-duality work you know so he dropped some deep
truth on him and this guy spent the next few
nights vomiting in a toilet all night long in this
retreat because he couldn't sleep he was so disturbed by
all of his own [ __ ] and self-deceptions that
were revealed to him this guy was a successful young
guy he you know he had a nice car in
nice house had a nice girlfriend he had a nice
career he had money and wealth and all this and
success but then he realized that all of this everything
he was building is just a house of cards made
out of [ __ ] it's all self-deception and he
spent the night vomiting in a toilet that's how real
this stuff is this is not mere hypothetical philosophy I'm
not kidding that's what it's like that's why you can't
self actualize in a week or in a month or
even in a year it's too much for you to
handle it's too distressing you have to do it very
very slowly if you try to do too much too
fast you got an ego backlash and then you actually
regress even deeper into all your unconscious habits you probably
notice that happened to you before if you've been on
this path for a few years you've noticed that your
entire mind-body organism will revolt against the truth it will
revolt against self reflecting and noticing its own self deceptions
you will actually become physically ill you will become depressed
angry fearful guilty lonely you will start to crave sex
and food and video games you'll just want to go
grab a greasy burger jerk off to some porn and
play your favorite video games for the next month to
forget all about this conversation that's the power of the
mind that is the self deception at work every time
you try to change yourself you try to improve yourself
what happens you fall back the mind tricks you it
has all these little tricks that it plays you make
plans to start meditation tomorrow and then what happens to
your plans they fall through you don't stick with it
you make plans for your new year's resolution what happens
they fall through you don't stick with it of course
that's homeostasis that is the mind helping you to maintain
yourself and you might think that you want change but
do you really do you really understand what change entails
change entails a death of the self even a little
change even a little change like losing 20 pounds that
involves killing the old 20 pound overweight self so yeah
it's difficult this is a very personal process very personal
and that's why there can't be any one approach to
spirituality or to personal development because everybody is different everybody
needs to take this process at their own pace everyone
has their own personal problems they have to overcome their
own personal demons and your own personal demons they're purely
your own they're a complete illusion so they don't make
sense to anybody else so for example you might be
deathly afraid of talking to girls or you might be
deathly afraid of starting your business or you might be
deathly afraid of something else and these fears that you
have they're completely irrational complete illusions so when you talk
about them to somebody else like when a shy person
asks advice from a confident person it doesn't click because
of the confident person it makes no sense why you
would be shy of course because they don't have that
inner demon that you have as a shy person of
course not so you got to go find the solutions
that will work for your particular inner demons that's why
I encourage a broad and diverse approach to personal development
because I don't think that any one technique or style
fits everybody you need to customize it which makes it
complicated which means that I can't give you all the
answers and neither can anybody else you got to put
the pieces together yourself you can't outsource this process your
own self deceptions are your own and only you can
know what they are I can't really know what they
are sometimes I can just by looking at a person
but you know not not the really deep and subtle
ones that are really the biggest drivers in your life
those only you can know and a scientist can't tell
you there's no scientific way to know this stuff this
can only be known by turning inwards so the scientific
methods not going to help you clinical studies or not
gonna help you clinical research is not gonna help you
you got to turn inwards yourself roll up your sleeves
and face your own inner demons and of course what
does the mind hate the most investigating a cell and
self-deception of course of course of course because the devil
has designed himself in such a way that the devil
never looks at his own devilry that's what it means
to be a devil because if the devil actually truly
looked inward and saw his own devilry he would get
so disgusted by it that he would stop and therefore
he would become an angel not a devil the only
way you can stay a devil is by being blind
to the fact that you're a devil and then you're
denying that you're a devil so of course you deny
you're a devil Trump denies he's a devil I deny
that I'm a devil everybody denies that they're a devil
that's just the nature of the mind there's this powerful
analogy that I really like which is jailbreaking your mind
in the same way that you might jailbreak a smartphone
and I'll actually probably shoot a dedicated episode just about
this jailbreaking analogy because I think it's very powerful it
sort of frames self actualization and non-duality very nicely for
me at least I don't know if you've ever tried
jailbreaking your smartphone because you wanted to get some better
performance out of it you wanted to install some apps
that that could do things that couldn't be done on
your manufacturers operating system so you have to jailbreak it
you have to hack through the manufacturers system but then
of course the manufacturer installs software that is anti hacking
software that is designed to prevent your jailbreaking so then
the hackers have to design a even better hacking system
which will out hack the anti hacking systems installed by
the manufacturer and so it's this sort of game and
that's exactly what this process of unraveling your own self-deceptions
is like for me it's like trying to jailbreak your
own mind but it's actually much more interesting and much
more tricky than that because when it comes to your
phone again you're not personally involved so if you break
your phone yeah that's dangerous and that might set you
back 500 bucks a thousand bucks you bought the new
iPhone you know thousand dollar iPhone and you're trying to
jailbreak this thing and then you end up breaking it
man that's a that's gonna sting for a few days
but still not nearly as much as it will sting
to get to the bottom of your own personal self-deceptions
within your own mind you see because the problem when
it comes to your own mind is that you are
your mind it's not like there's a you here and
a mind here and there's separate things there one thing
so really when you get the bright idea to jailbreak
your mind that's actually coming from the mind the mind
is trying to jailbreak itself which is this very twisted
strange strange loop because how do you jailbreak yourself the
mind knows all of its own attempts to jailbreak itself
and it can easily stop those so it's the sort
of tug-of-war this conflict within yourself you're trying to out
hack yourself how do you do that it's sort of
like you're trying to play chess with yourself but you
know all of the secret strategies that the other side
will use against you because you are the other side
and it can't be any other way because that reality
is non-dual so it's one the self is one thing
so it's this very twisted strange loop and yet nevertheless
it is possible you might think that well that means
that leo it's impossible to jailbreak the mind no it
is it's possible it's just that the final straw that
breaks the camel's back that will not actually come from
the mind you will use your mind to try to
escape your mind but eventually whether you actually make the
final leap outside of your mind that would be enlightenment
that's not gonna come from you that's gonna come from
outside of you that's gonna come from beyond your mind
and beyond the ego which is why enlightenment is so
frustrating because really you don't have control you're just sort
of sitting there waiting for lightning to strike and maybe
it will and maybe it won't but of course don't
take that to mean that effort doesn't matter effort matters
a lot if you go up high on a hill
in a thunderstorm with a long tall metal flagpole and
you're waving it around there's a good chance lightning will
strike you so you can certainly increase your odds of
getting a good solid lightning strike and that's what you're
doing when you're meditating yourself inquiring or taking a psychedelic
or something like that so that's what self-actualization is about
it's about jailbreaking your mind that's what enlightenment is about
but it's not only enlightenment that we're talking about here
again don't think that with enlightenment your mind is completely
jailbroken and now you're completely immune to all self-deception no
that's not how it works that's way too simple and
in fact that itself is a self-deception people who just
pursue enlightenment single-mindedly thinking that's gonna solve all their problems
in life and that's gonna make them immune to all
self-deceptions these people become Zen Devils they become very diluted
because there's nothing quite like a few enlightenment experiences to
make you feel like now you've got the truth now
you've seen God and the absolute and now you're invincible
and now everything you do and say is right that's
the ultimate source of self-deception right there you can see
how the mind will use that against you even after
enlightenment the mind will still be there it'll still be
sneaky and tricky it'll still get you with all your
emotions and all your old habits and all your addictions
those will not magically just go away it'll help enlightenment
helps with becoming more conscious of that it's a really
big step towards becoming non self deceived but it's not
the its ultimate it's not like the ultimate magic pill
solution you have to take into account what I'm talking
about here and you have to be much more nuanced
it has to be much broader than just merely enlightenment
because your self-deception extends way beyond just your perceptions of
the world it extends to your relationships to the way
you run your career and your business to how you
interact with your co-workers to your family and your children
to everything everything so in a nutshell what is the
mind up to it's trying to prevent self-reflection and why
would it do that because everything is an illusion and
because for the illusion to feel real you need to
not see that it's an illusion how do you see
that it's not an illusion or how do you not
see that it's an illusion well you just fail to
self-reflect and you're attached to reality you want reality to
be real you don't want reality to be revealed as
an illusion so therefore you are going to do everything
in your power not to self-reflect it's sort of like
you're a magician who has tricked himself with his own
magic trick by erasing his own memory that of how
he accomplishes the magic trick such that heat while he's
doing the magic trick he is both the magician and
the audience at the same time that's what's going on
here you are God deceiving itself into thinking that it's
not God but that it's you said uh that's what's
really going on here sometimes atheists will pose the following
question to theists they will say oh well but if
God exists and you say God is all-powerful at all
infinite then riddle me this could God create a stone
that he himself could not lift supposedly he should be
able to because he's all-powerful and yet if he can't
lift it that means he doesn't have the power so
which is it it's a contradiction which means that there
can't be a god it's way stranger it's way more
[ __ ] up than this the situation is as
follows God is so infinitely powerful that he has the
power to deceive himself that He is God so that's
precisely how you came into being is that you are
God shrieking yourself thinking that you aren't God but that
you're a finite little human being sitting there right there
that's how you got here that's what's going on here
and for you to keep playing that role you need
to keep yourself in the dark it's a very twisted
thing you're tricking yourself and you might wonder how is
it possible that God could trick itself if God is
all-powerful but then you realize that what it means to
be all-powerful is precisely that you can do that if
God couldn't trick himself he wouldn't be all-powerful that's what
infinity means infinity includes all the finitude of which you
are one as this little mortal human being but simultaneously
are also the infinite it's paradox it's a strange loop
of course as it must be because everything is one
so what's the solution to self-deception self-reflection very simple and
what does self-reflection mean it means questioning everything you hold
as certain about yourself and about the world without getting
distracted by all the red herrings out there what will
happen at the end of this self-reflection process if you
accomplish it the melting away of all your illusions and
what they call liberation that's what liberation means the end
of self-deception so in a simplistic schematic here really what
all personal growth boils down to is moving from a
place of maximum self-deception to a place of minimal self-deception
so imagine that at this end we have the worst
possible life like a heroin junkie who's on the brink
of suicide just cannot help himself at all let's say
that he's at 99% self-deception and if he starts to
work on himself cure himself of his addictions and then
go on working more and more and more and doing
self-actualization work and then spiritual work and non-duality work and
all this sort of stuff he's gonna be moving more
towards this end and at this end we might have
the let's say the the enlightened yogi and he might
think that the aligned yogi is at 0% self-deception and
ideally that's where he would be but in practise that's
not the case in practice most Yogi's are still deluded
still self deceived most enlightened people still have many self-deceptions
because they're they're not aware of this larger dynamic that
I'm talking about and so and so even there he
might be enlightened but he's like 10% self-deceived still cuz
he still got all his mind stuff there's still mind
stuff there's still cultural dogmas and beliefs and ideas and
there's still a bunch of stuff all right just because
even becoming lion doesn't mean you transform your entire mind
and get rid of all the self-deception they're still there
so ideally you'd be moving closer and closer to 0%
self-deception and the more you do that the less suffering
you will have in your life because the suffering is
a direct consequence of misalignment of your life to truth
which is why you know that someone like Donald Trump
must suffer a great deal even if he doesn't admit
it to himself because you see that he lies constantly
he can't avoid lying because that's his whole mode of
living he's more on this under the spectrum and then
of course not only does he suffer but all the
people around him suffer and the whole nation will suffer
for it of course as it must because that's what
you get with lying that's what you get when you're
fast and loose with the truth that's just the nature
of the self that's the nature of being a devil
when you're a devil you are so much a devil
that you don't even know that you're a devil or
that there's any other way and in fact because you're
so adept at lying of course you're gonna use that
lie against yourself to lie to yourself to tell yourself
that you're not the devil and that actually you're not
even suffering but that actually this is the only way
that life can be and that actually you're enjoying life
because you're rich and you're famous and you're president and
you're all this and so therefore hey this is great
I'm actually enjoying myself this is exciting this is stimulating
but actually deep down there's just this ocean of suffering
which if this person ever actually glanced at it would
utterly horrifying some people are so far gone that they're
never gonna be able to look upon that ocean because
there's there's just such a deep history deck decades of
lies upon lies to see that to come to grips
with that that would be so painful that they would
rather die than do that and that's why people do
commit suicide rather than self actualizing it's a real thing
happens all the time or they just keep lying to
themselves until they die of natural causes that's also a
common way out of this problem you see that takes
care of all problems but wouldn't it be nicer to
put an end to it yourself while you're still alive
cuz then you can enjoy life without your giant ego
without all the suffering that comes from being a self
being lost in the self so that's how this process
works if you ever get the idea that you're immune
to this process you're immune to self-deception for whatever reason
whatever justifications your mind spins up you can be sure
that you're totally self deceived if you ever get the
idea that you've become enlightened and now you're you're at
full Buddhahood and now you're immune to self-deception you've fallen
right into it self-deception is not one or two things
it's not one or two traps self-deception is a mind
field it's a it's a thousand mile long minefield with
millions of minds and just because you've avoided stepping on
one don't get too eager don't pat yourself on the
back too much because there's another one just a few
feet in front of you and if you get all
giddy and think oh look look I've avoided this landmine
right here look I've avoided it and you started jumping
around prancing around skipping around you're gonna step on the
next landmine so be very careful be careful not to
think that just because you heard me talking about this
that all the sudden now you have all the tools
and equipment that you need to avoid self-deception in your
life not a chance not even close you're not even
1% of the way to understanding what's being said here
and pointed to nor should you get the bright idea
that I'm saying that I am above self-deception and that
because I'm talking about this topic that all of a
sudden I must be the expert I must know all
the traps and therefore I must be immune of course
not that's the exact opposite of what I'm saying what
I'm saying is that all of us are equally well
not equally some of us more so but all of
us are highly vulnerable to self-deception including myself and there
have been many times in my life where I've deceived
myself and there will be more in the future and
I don't ever anticipate getting to a point where that
will ever stop nor should you this is something that
when you understand how deceptive the mind is it it
AHS you it's awesome it's incredible it's a work of
art this is God's art God's artistry is in the
fact that he is able to deceive so artfully and
skillfully and subtly and and it's beautiful it's a work
of art when you start to see it but at
the same time it's sort of a horrifying work of
art because you see that it's not this artwork is
not just hanging on a wall it is you you
are it and it can be ugly sometimes this is
not the kind of art that's just sugary and sweet
this is sort of bittersweet art which can look horrified
and terrifying from certain angles especially when you first glimpse
it you have to develop a taste for God's artwork
it tends to be rather brutal and rather brusque you
know it doesn't coddle you in the way that you
want in the way that your ego wants because it's
perfectly impersonal it's not about you it's not about protecting
you it's not about serving you it's not about your
family it's not making it about making you rich or
making you live longer or making you feel better or
making you have a nice self-image it's not about any
of that it's about everything coming into existence it's about
being it's about something much much larger than any individual
self could ever be it's about infinite diversity inveted intelligence
infinite evolutionary capacity which utterly Dwarfs you and your self
agenda and everything that we have going on on this
planet in this solar system in this universe it Dwarfs
all of that all of that is just like a
little speck of sand a little grain of sand in
the larger scheme of things and yet at the same
time it's not separate from you it is you it
was all engineered by you you've just tricked yourself into
thinking that you're separate and that it's not your doing
precisely so that you could experience the Marvel of discovery
of how amazing reality is because if you knew all
of reality it would lose its magic to you in
a certain sense there's something nice about being able to
discover it for the first time as if for the
first time the problem generally is that people's imaginations are
too limited to imagine all the ways in which they
deceive themselves they totally underestimate this phenomena your number one
concern in life should be curing yourself of self-deception that's
basically it almost nothing else matters everything else is peanuts
compared to this if you can accomplish this you'll get
everything you want and infinitely more and if you fail
to accomplish this then no matter what you get no
matter how much success you have you're gonna be unsatisfied
this is the key and that's really what actualize that
work is about is helping to point out these self-deceptions
to you your goal is to jailbreak your mind and
my goal is to help you to jailbreak your mind
and also to jailbreak my own mind and so we're
all in this process together trying to jailbreak our own
minds but of course no one is really perfect at
it so we're all fallible including myself therefore you have
to maintain a certain attitude of humility but you do
have to carry on with this process you don't want
to just shrug your shoulders and say oh well if
we're all self deceived then that's just how it's supposed
to be and there's nothing to do and there's no
improvement possible no there's a lot of improvement possible if
you just move from 99% self-deception to 20% so that's
going to be a huge transformation in your life that
will be the difference between going from a suicidal depressed
life to a miraculous life a life where you're you're
walking around in tears because of how beautiful everything is
I'm not really done with this topic we've just started
I'm actually writing a whole book on this topic of
epistemology and self-deception and I have hundreds of pages of
notes detailing in in very specific ways various patterns that
I found that the mind deceived itself so I'll be
sharing more of those with you in fact there's gonna
be a part two to this series here about self-deception
coming next week where I will talk about some of
the top self deception mechanisms that I found these are
very concrete ways in which you deceive yourself I wanted
to use this episode to sort of set up the
framework because I'm gonna be referencing this concept of self-deception
a lot going forward in the future and of course
if you look at my prior episodes you should also
see that if I don't mention it explicitly I'm still
talking about self-deception implicitly and many of those episodes but
I'll be talking more about it explicitly and in part
two next week I will talk about these self-deception mechanisms
I've been studying these four years keeping careful logs monitoring
myself monitoring other people monitoring society at large humanity at
large looking through history try to find these self-deception mechanisms
it's how your own mind gets you to believe in
all sorts of nonsense and how it tricks yourself this
is meta knowledge that you're getting here this is the
very type of knowledge that your mind does not want
you to get so make sure that you stick around
for that but for now that's it please click like
button for me and come check out actualized org I
have some exclusive stuff on the website that you won't
find anywhere else like on the blog I'm posting new
videos these days that are exclusive to the blog you
won't see them on YouTube or on iTunes or anywhere
else so check that out check out the forum check
out my life purpose course check out the book list
the book list has a lot of important books on
it that you need to read if you want to
get a handle on this self-deception thing these books will
point out the selfs accession to you within science history
philosophy psychology medicine and spirituality within yourself within society at
large these books will help to point that out to
you what I'm talking about here is sort of like
a larger framework and now you need to fill in
all the little details and so as we go forward
in the future I'll be helping you to fill in
those details like with part two of this series but
then also even going beyond that you're gonna see my
video is becoming more epidemiological becoming deeper focusing more on
these core issues of how the mind tricks itself because
that's all that really I can do to help you
is I can sort of point out the traps and
the landmines and then hopefully once you see a lot
of those you start to catch on to the patterns
of your own mind you start to see how tricky
it is and then you you get better and better
and better at at overcoming many of these obstacles so
that's coming stick around you
