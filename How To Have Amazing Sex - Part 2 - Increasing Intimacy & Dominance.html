hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm excited to be talking about how to have
amazing sex part two this version here is for guys
and we're gonna be specifically talking about how to increase
intimacy and dominance like I said this video here is
part two so I've got part one which you should
go and watch first that's gonna set the foundation for
what it means to have amazing sex if you're a
guy so basically what we're talking about here is how
do you really really really please your girl and at
the same time you're also pleasing yourself so go ahead
and watch part one and here if you if you're
coming from part one part one basically said that there
are like two pillars to amazing sex we also talked
about some of the psychology that you need to have
to bring into the bedroom to have amazing sex and
how you need to think about things and I also
outline there a lot of the the actual process that
I use myself that you can just copy and improvise
on yourself but the two pillars I want to go
into a lot of depth here because in that video
I promised that I would cover these two pillars and
I would give you specific exact tangible things that you
could do right now tomorrow in your sex life that
will increase intimacy and increase dominance and therefore lead to
amazing sex if you do this women will go crazy
for you they will get addicted to you like a
drug because women are emotional creatures and all women love
amazing emotional deep dirty intimate hardcore sex so that's what
I'm excited to share with you here right off the
bat one warning that I need to give you guys
is that some of you guys are very overly concerned
about mechanics the mechanics of sex as guys we need
to think of sex as a physical act I want
to challenge you to start to think of sex not
as a mechanical activity but as an emotional activity the
power of sex lies in emotions especially from the woman's
point of view so well here I'm gonna want to
tell I'm gonna show you how to do is how
to use very simple practical techniques to build up the
emotions to amp them up so that both of you
can have an amazing experience right it's not about the
mechanics it's more about the intent behind the way that
you execute stuff you don't need to be some mechanical
master or technician who's got all the techniques down that's
really not what amazing sex is about it's more about
the connection it's more about the attitude that you take
and how you make yourself feel and the way that
you make yourself feel will then be reflected in her
and it'll be a great experience so the two pillars
are intimacy and dominance amazing sex comes from having both
of these things inter playing with each other in the
present moment so I'm gonna talk a little bit more
about this towards the end of the video but basically
what you're gonna want to do is you don't want
to do a 1 to 1 ratio roughly speaking which
means one intimate thing for one dominant thing and you're
gonna kind of sprinkle them in randomly you're gonna mix
them up and you know some nights you'll do something
really dominant and some nights maybe the theme will be
very intimate and some nights it'll be a mix but
generally start off by doing a 1 to 1 ratio
then you can improvise on this stuff later as you
kind of spice stuff up I'll talk about that later
so first let's just go right into tips for how
to increase intimacy and then I'm gonna do tips for
have increased dominance right and as a guy you're probably
going to be resonating much more with how to increase
dominance than intimacy because you naturally feel like well I'm
a masculine guy I want to be a masculine guy
in the bedroom that's kind of what we're assuming here
with these videos you know the traditional masculine feminine dynamic
is at play here and that will come easy to
you to be more masculine and more dominant but here
with intimacy I'm almost asking you to be more feminine
and it's gonna seem like oh but I don't want
to be more feminine that's not right but I want
you to open your mind and in fact the thing
that you're probably missing in your sex life the most
is the intimacy if you're like a regular guy then
I find that regular guys are okay with dominance but
they're really really bad with intimacy and this is why
lots of women complain about bad sex so really challenge
yourself remember that you're gonna be sprinkling the intimate stuff
in with the dominant stuff so you're not going to
be perceived as feminine when you do this in fact
it's gonna amplify your dominance right women love this women
love being intimate with their man so if you've got
any kind of emotional hurdles that you have to overcome
to do this intimacy stuff then go ahead and you
work that out that's your issue you got to fix
that in yourself so one really big way to amp
up intimacy is with deep intimate eye contact deep intimate
eye contact it's kind of like a soft loving look
that you give the girl if you're having sex with
her make sure you're looking her in the eyes this
is very very important for building that intimate connection if
you're having sex I'm not looking your barrel in the
eyes you're missing out on a lot of great opportunities
just right there the other thing that I like for
intimacy is using little words of affectation so little words
like baby my little girl hey cutie hey sweetie hey
honey this kind of stuff right these little words you
can use them in your phone conversations you can use
them in your text conversations you can use them in
person and then of course you should be using them
in the bedroom too oh and by the way if
you haven't figured out yet you to be doing lots
of conversation and talk when you're having sex don't be
the guy who's having sex in silence silent sex is
lame sex you should be saying stuff and we're gonna
get to that in a minute here so those are
some little phrases that you can throw in there and
you can start your sentences whatever you want to tell
her you can always just preface it with hey baby
or hey cutie or hey sweetie or whatever next is
just a general theme that you can use is anything
that you can do to play up her femininity is
a good thing and you should take advantage of that
sometimes people ask me hey Leo why do you call
women girls girls is like making you sound like a
pedophile call women women well you know the reason I
call women girls a lot of times is because it
plays up that femininity and they actually enjoy that especially
when you're talking about an intimate relationship you know call
your girl your girl and any other kind of things
you can do to play a pro femininity is really
good stuff like just holding her hand or leading her
around you know you being masked on her being feminine
um letting her be comfortable - femininity complimenting her on
her femininity complimenting her on her beauty this kind of
stuff is really really good right because in the end
what do you want in the bedroom you want her
to be very very feminine right so start setting that
frame long before you actually get her in the bedroom
and then she'll naturally have that frame already said and
she'll just play that role when you are in the
bedroom all right and you can also compliment her when
she's having sex with you and she's being very hot
and dirty and feminine you can compliment her on that
too and that will reinforce her femininity it'll make her
feel like she can be feminine around you and you
want her to feel safe and open to do that
right don't don't bash her on her femininity so if
she's a little bit emotional here or there or whatever
and it's within you know reasonable limits then let her
that that's kind of why she's in the relationship in
the first place next is kissing make sure you get
good at kissing I'm not gonna go into too much
technique here you could probably watch some other videos someplace
or basically go practice on a bunch of girls or
practice with one girl get good with kissing get good
with kissing in different ways give her light soft kisses
those would be more intimate you can also do more
hard kind of dirty kisses deeper kisses those could be
more dominant but basically you know know how to rub
her lips rub your lips on her lips gently caress
her lips with your lips without even kissing but then
you can go into kissing you can also go into
a little bit of tongue licking and flicking with your
tongue on her lips you can suck on her top
lip you can suck on her bottom lip you can
suck on both lips there's a lot of different variety
that you can do with them with kissing so I'll
just let you experiment with that make sure that you
get really good and experienced and comfortable of that especially
the light and soft kind of kissing that can really
melt a girl's heart if you know how to do
that right the other thing that you should do is
you should do like I said more talking and what
I'm talking about here specifically is intimate talk things you
can say that build up intimacy what is intimacy a
good question a since we're talking about it well really
intimacy is this special bond that you're building between you
and her right this is what makes your relationship feel
like a relationship this is what makes your relationship feels
different than the relationship that you have with your guy
friends or she has with her girlfriends and the way
that you do that basically is by being able to
open up to be vulnerable to kind of be caring
and loving towards each other and to be building something
special that's special connection where you two understand each other
on a deep level intimate level you share things about
yourself that you normally wouldn't share with anybody else so
that's what's really cool about being in an intimate relationship
in the first place is that you do get that
kind of like deep very raw connection that you don't
get with your guy friends and that she doesn't get
with her girl friends and you don't get this with
your parents or with really anybody in life except your
intimate partner so this is a cool thing you have
to want this right some guys some guys actually have
a lot of difficulty being intimate because they've had screwed-up
childhoods or they've been in some terrible relationships that have
kind of burned them or whatever and now they're in
able and incapable of being intimate well again that's something
much deeper that you're gonna have to work out maybe
with a therapist or with a life coach or maybe
through another video that I'll shoot on that topic but
I'm assuming here that you want to be intimate because
this is a cool thing so here's intimate talk and
intimate talk the secret to it is not so much
what you say as the tone with which you say
it again it's the tone right your tone is gonna
be softer it's gonna be more loving almost like you're
reassuring someone imagine that you're talking someone who's just lost
someone in their family right and they're crying you want
to reassure them you gonna take a very kind of
a soft light type of approach it can be very
compassionate that's the tone you're taking here and in fact
you can do this whispering which is a really great
thing especially when you're having sex and she's like right
near your mouth like her ears near your mouth or
whatever you can whisper something intimate in her ear here's
a couple of examples I want to have another video
that talks how to specifically do really good turdy talk
but I just want to throw out a couple of
examples of intimate talk something like hey baby I want
to come inside you or hey cutie are you getting
all wet for me or something like hey baby I
feel so close to you now these might sound a
little corny a little bit like sappy a little bit
too lovey-dovey but that's the whole idea that's what intimacy
is is this lovey-dovey thing now if you're just instantly
rejecting this out of hand like oh well Leo I
don't want to do that and it's coming you look
like a [ __ ] or something I urge you
to reconsider because again you're not gonna be doing this
the whole time there's gonna be a lot of DOM
and stuff that you're gonna do so stuff it's gonna
all balance out in the end but you know if
all you are is just this like dominating sex machine
in the bedroom that's not really what women want women
do want this intimacy and they're gonna value a guy
who offers them this intimacy much more than one who
doesn't because you got to look at a relationship from
a woman's perspective from a woman's perspective the thing that
she really wants inside her intimate relationship is deep emotional
rapport with you her man she doesn't want just sex
she doesn't just want a companion or a best friend
she wants deep intimacy in her relationship so anyways you
know experiment there's a lot of different ways that you
can do intimate talk find your favorite phrases you can
even sit down and just write stuff out memorize it
and then practice it in the bedroom also a great
way to build intimacy is with gentle physical touch right
like caressing her face gently just slowly gliding your hands
over her body stroking her hair getting her a little
kiss on the cheek or on the forehead this kind
of stuff this is really really really good stuff you
know it can be just very subtle stuff but it
all adds up and she's gonna be very sensitive to
this kind of stuff next is the sex positions so
of course probably the most intimate sex position I would
say is the most basic one just missionary missionary is
great because you're face to face also because you can
whisper in her ear also because you've got that strong
amazing eye contact also because your bodies are completely pressed
together which gives you a real intimate feeling especially when
your stomach is pressed against her stomach and you're inside
her that's super super intimate so that's really really good
stuff make sure that you take full advantage of the
missionary position right the way you take advantage of it
is that you whisper stuff in our ear while you're
in the missionary position next is just a little phrase
called I love you women love to hear I love
you now depends on where you are in your relationship
now if you haven't gotten to the I love you
phase yet then don't say it if you don't comfortable
feel comfortable saying it or you don't feel like it's
honest for you then don't say it but if you're
there then make sure that you say I love you
and say it a lot and state especially when you're
having sex with her and say it especially when you're
about to [ __ ] inside her speaking of which
if you really want to increase your intimacy a lot
then get her to the point where you can be
having sex with her without condoms and also where she's
on birth control and you can be coming inside of
her this is the most intimate thing that you can
do is to be coming inside or without a condom
so if you can manage that situation not only does
that just feel amazing and it's like sex which is
ten times better than without a condom but it's super
super super intimate and her response to you after you
actually come inside her is gonna be very different than
if you use a condom right even the chemicals inside
your sperm have a physiological response on her even days
later when they're absorbed inside her body it's there's some
pretty cool science behind that which I won't go into
here other stuff you can do to increase intimacy is
holding her cuddling with her stuff like holding her hand
or cuddling together after sex or before sex or on
the couch or whatever I mean personally I love cuddling
to me it's an amazing thing it almost as great
as sex you should be taking full advantage of this
don't skimp on the cuddling especially the moment after you
come inside her and you finish sex do not just
roll over and fall asleep or walk out of the
room or go take a shower or whatever the [
__ ] you usually do what you want to do
is you want to cuddle with her spoon her cuddle
with her that's gonna build massive massive intimacy and kudo
points for you just five minutes of cuddling and you
should be doing this for yourself too this is just
an amazing feeling you know putting inside a girl then
cuddling with her for five or ten minutes or whatever
after that is just awesome so hopefully you're doing this
if you're not doing this you're missing out on a
ton of amazing stuff and your girl is missing out
on this kind of amazing stuff and the last thing
that I'll say about intimacy is learn how to make
your girl squirt squirting is super super super super intimate
I have a whole video which is called how to
make a girl squirt it's one of my most my
most watched videos of all time so go ahead and
check that one out search for it that one will
teach you exactly the technique and the psychological aspects of
how to make a girl squirt you could make virtually
any girl squirt if you do it right all it
really requires is the building of the intimacy and learning
some basic techniques so make sure that you experiment and
get that process down get that handled so you can
do it with any girl all right so that their
covers intimacy now what I want to do is I
want to move on to dominance so here are some
tips for how to increase dominance and this stuff will
feel probably a little bit more natural to you but
there's still stuff you can learn here because a lot
of guys miss out on this cool dominant stuff see
of course a woman wants deep intimacy with her man
in her relationship but also what she wants if she
wants to know that she's in a relationship with a
[ __ ] man a [ __ ] boss the
guy who knows what he's doing a leader and the
guy who's going to dominate her ass in the bedroom
she wants that so the masculine in you brings out
the feminine in her and this polarity creates that charge
and that fire and that spark which is so hot
in a intimate relationship so you want to amp up
your masculinity and your dominance and here's how you're gonna
do it number one is with your eye contact and
here you do it with fierce eye contact you can
give an intimate look which is kind of like a
soft gentle tan a loving look or even give a
fierce kind of like I'm about to stab you in
the gut with a knife in prison kind of look
I'm about to shank you right that kind of like
hmm I want to punch you in the face kind
of look but don't go over the top you don't
want to look like a like a psycho serial killer
you know just give her that kind of like fierce
squit your eyes maybe tilt your head down like this
and just kind of like give her a really kind
of serious look and in your own mind when you
look at her like that you should be thinking to
yourself that's right I'm gonna [ __ ] your brains
out that's the kind of look you want to give
her and when you think that and you look at
her that way she's gonna feel that women are very
sensitive to your internal emotional state and what you communicate
here with your eyes they're very sensitive to it subconsciously
so you want to use this to great effect if
you've got hesitation in your eyes if you've got weakness
in your eyes if you're not sure if you're stuck
in your head she's gonna read all that off you
right that's not a very dominant fierce look a fierce
look is very mm I know exactly what I want
and I want you and I'm gonna [ __ ]
you get ready to be [ __ ] that kind
of look the next thing that you can use to
increase dominance is oh I love this one it's growling
I hope you try this with your girl dude I
notice her getting turned on a lot if you try
growling what do I mean by growl it's this here
that it's like this deep guttural growl sound that you
make with the with the bottom of your throat right
here in your chest so go ahead and practice that
with me right now actually I can't do it that
much because if I do it too much my throat
starts to get scratchy and sore but you know just
a couple of those growls especially like if you're having
sex with her and a missionary position her and her
her ears are right next to your throat she can
actually feel the vibrations from your throat and you give
her that growl that's gonna turn her on so much
that's like playing up that kind of like a man
animalistic I'm gonna dominate you roll that makes you very
masculine makes her feel very feminine like she's getting dominated
the other thing that I like to do with the
growling is that you can also do little growls even
outside the bedroom like if you give her a kiss
and then you can give her a little growl something
like this just a little short little one like that
it just has this amazing effect on the women I
don't know it just does another cool thing you can
do is biting of the neck right this is very
primal and animalistic too and you don't want to bite
real hard you just want to give her a soft
little bite but basically you start kissing her face maybe
start kissing with her mouth with her lips then you
move down her face then you brush her hair aside
and then you just start kissing here along the neck
and as you're kissing then you can go in for
that bite like that start lightly and then if she
can tolerate more then go in harder some women are
super super turned on by this because the neck region
here is very very sensitive and it's also very intimate
but also the same time very dominant this is a
very great move the next thing we should talk about
is dominant talk I want you to be practicing dominant
talk in the bedroom and here's some examples of what
dominant talk sounds like again it's not so much about
the words you use but about the tonality and your
own internal emotional state when you say these words so
notice how I say these I'm gonna try to put
myself in to have a dominant tonality as I do
it I'm a nail a little [ __ ] to
the wall I'm gonna [ __ ] your brains out
get down on your knees and suck my [ __
] so you notice how different the tone of these
are compared to the stuff that I was saying with
the intimate talk right very different basically here you're being
authoritative you're being a bit dickish or like an [
__ ] you're basically giving her a command many times
hey get down and suck my [ __ ] write
the words you choose can also play some importance for
example when you say something like [ __ ] that
can be a very dominant sounding word when you say
it in the right way also when you say that
you're gonna [ __ ] her brains out the word
[ __ ] is a dominant kind of word so
you know choose your words but also save them with
authority say them like you're the boss and you should
feel like the boss right put yourself in that frame
of mind where like you're the boss she's your little
sex slave and you've got your dominant talk down right
there's so many different variations you could sit down and
just spend whole day brainstorming variations and then trying them
out with your girl now be careful here I'm not
telling you here to actually be dominating your woman in
in everyday life that's not what I'm saying I'm not
saying here that women should be dominated and that's somehow
you're above them and that she's literally your slave or
whatever right no in fact what I at kate is
a no control attitude towards the woman in your relationship
so you actually do not try to control her at
all if she wants to leave she leaves if if
she wants her way she can get her way but
in the bedroom right you're kind of playing a role
so these things you tell her you're not taking them
too seriously out right this is not this is not
licensed to be like an abusive boyfriend that's not what
I'm telling you to be so don't make that mistake
okay the next point is rough physical touch so we
talked about gentle intimate physical touch now let's talk about
some rough stuff right so one thing you can do
is you can grip her you can grip her arms
you can grip her hands you can bind her hands
you can grip her thighs you can grip her waist
you can grip her neck so there's a lot of
different ways that you can grip her of course do
it in a way where you're not injuring her or
freaking her out which actually brings me to an important
point that I should have talked about earlier is that
you want to make her feel safe in all this
right it's like you two are choosing to play these
roles but there's never a sense of like danger for
her she never feels like you're really gonna like beat
the [ __ ] out of her or whatever she
feels safe with you she's getting dominated but she feels
completely safe and she trusts you so you have to
build that trust and you have to honor that trust
I can't be a fake trust that means you know
if she's afraid or something's weird or whatever then you
back off you're not like forcing yourself on her you're
not raping her or any of this kind of stuff
right not for real you can play up some rape
fantasy but you're not actually raping her very important point
okay so let's get back to other physical kinds of
rough touch so the other thing you can do is
jerk emotions right maybe what you want to do is
you want to grab her by the hips and then
kind of jerk her hips over to your hips or
maybe what you want to do is you want to
like grab her by the neck and pull her over
like grab her head and pull it down towards you
and then make out with her kind of in a
rough manner or maybe you want to take her hands
and you know throw them above her head or something
like that and restrain her um he's kind of like
quick jerky motions those can be good just make sure
that you don't like hit her head on a coffee
table or on a bedpost or something like that you
know watch out for her safety because you are leading
very very awesome dominant physical touch is the restraining of
the hands like for example if you are standing with
her next to a wall and what you can do
is you can take her hands put them above her
head like this and restrain them and then put your
hand in between like this as you hold both of
them like this and then maybe you're making out with
her or you're fingering her or whatever you're doing with
her right and you press her hands like this above
her head right up against the wall so that's a
good way to restrain the hands or maybe you restrain
her hands behind her back back behind her butt and
you hold them there for a while as you're having
sex with her as you're doing something else so those
are all really good things the next really cool trick
for dominance is ripping off the panties you ever tried
this you got a girl and what you do is
you rip through her panties this is super dominant I
really encourage you to try this it's really hot the
only thing is that you don't want to rip through
like a super expensive pair of Victoria's Secret panties so
maybe you can coordinate with this her with her somehow
or maybe you can just kind of keep an eye
out for when she's wearing panties that aren't too fancy
and what you do is you just rip through those
suckers and what that produces that produces the following that
ripping sound that ripping sound this this whole thing of
ripping our panties off this is almost like playing into
the rape fantasy and actually a lot of women have
rape fantasies and they want to be dominated now get
this confused with actual literal rape I'm not telling you
to rape anyone I'm just telling you to play that
role with your girl if you think she's gonna be
comfortable with it and most girls will love it right
one point to keep in mind is that when you're
ripping off the panties make sure you do it in
a way where you're not actually like ripping the panties
on her body when you rip the panties use your
own strength and your own two hands to rip them
off don't like just pull her panties to one side
and just kind of tug on one side of the
panties because what it's gonna do is just cut the
panties are gonna cut into her thigh or in her
butt or even into her [ __ ] or something
like that you don't want to do that so make
sure that when you rip it you're not gonna be
hurting her but that could be real cool move other
stuff that you can do is you can tie her
up I recommend that you have some way to tie
her up that's handy in the bedroom you can buy
some soft kind of rope or some sort of like
bandage or ribbon type of thing that you can tie
her up with a really good trick here is to
buy some cheap neckties you can go to Walmart or
wherever buy some neckties for $5 and just keep like
three or four of them on your bedside in your
bedside drawer that's not actually what I have and you
can use those neckties in a lot of cool ways
if you've got the right type of bed you could
tie her to the bed post or to your bed
in some manner you can tie her hands you can
tie her feet you can you know experiment around with
that the other thing you can do is you can
tie a necktie around her hands like this and then
you can tie a knot on the other end of
the necktie just a single knot and what you can
do is you can walk up to a door open
the door throw the tie knot over the door and
then close the door so they're not as stuck on
the other end of the door jamb and then what
happens is that she's stuck pinned to the door with
her hands above her head like this and that's a
super intimate dominant and very clever way to tie up
a girl which only really requires one tie and a
door which every bedroom has so go ahead and experiment
with that one there that can be really hot other
dominant stuff you can do is you can do the
door slam or the wall slam and what this means
is that basically you slam her body either her hips
and her ass or the back of her shoulders or
even her full body into the wall or into the
door now you got to be little careful when you
do this you don't hurt her maybe what you want
to do is you want to put your hand behind
her head as you're doing it so that her skull
doesn't crash into anything and using the door is more
preferable because the door has a bit more softness to
it than a wall a wall is very very solid
so this is best done with a door also the
door is gonna kind of jiggle and the door is
gonna produce a sound that's gonna be just hot and
dominant sounding it's gonna really sound like a slam you
can't really slam her into the wall so much because
the walls just so solid you can't do a real
forceful slam with the door you get more leeway as
far as that goes and basically what you do there
is you slammer and then you make out with her
and then you pin her up and you basically [
__ ] her up against the wall you can [
__ ] her from the front [ __ ] her
from the back you can finger her you can make
out with her there's a lot of different variations that
can happen there other cool stuff you should experiment with
is biting spanking and choking I won't go too much
into this but if you're having sex in doggy style
make sure you spank her most girls love that most
girls you can spank pretty hard so you can just
kind of experiment soft spanking it first and then try
to go harder and harder and harder and just see
how much heat she can take also biting you can
not only bite her neck but you can bite other
parts of her body her hand her arm and what
else the sides of her hips the thighs you know
you can find stuff to buy just to be a
little careful in the sensitive areas especially on the inner
thighs and stuff like that choking you could do some
choking especially for example if you pin her up against
the wall which you can do is you can take
your hand put it across her throat and just kind
of press her mm-hmm press her gently and firmly to
the wall to the door and choke her a little
bit maybe as you're making out with her as your
fingering her or something like that again this one is
one of those we have to be why of you
know a little careful make sure that you are kind
of communicating with her eye to eye she feels safe
and that you're not actually choking her for real or
suffocating her any that kind of stuff I think you
get the idea there experiment also with dominant sex positions
what are some dominant sex positions well of course doggy
styles are really hot dominant one so you should be
doing that one that one's really great because you can
spank her as you're doing that you can also be
grabbing her hips and you could be slamming her hips
and her ass into you as you're having sex so
that one is really really good you can also do
a lot of dirty talk while you're having sex with
her in doggy style other dominant positions having sex standing
up is really dominant I find and again pinning her
up against something like a wall or a bookshelf or
a door or whatever else you got around the house
like a pillar or a post you know structural column
or whatever in your house that can be really really
good and you could have sex with her from the
front or from behind either of those is really nice
and dominant another one that I really like that's really
dominant is if you take her and you throw her
on to some furniture so for example a great one
is a a coffee table or a dinner table ideally
what you've got is you've got some sort of large
last surface like a dining table which is about waist
height for you actually a little bit lower is ideal
because she's gonna be lying on top of it you're
gonna be standing you're gonna have her legs kind of
spread open like this you're gonna be having sex with
her that can be a super super dominant and hot
position especially when you do it in a way that
kind of surprises her like maybe you're just like walking
by the kitchen and then you just grab her like
River panties off and then you just throw her on
the on the table and you're gonna tell you're gonna
[ __ ] her brains out and then you just
proceeded to do it that can be super super dominant
and the the other point that I want to make
here is that you should be approaching your sex with
a commanding and leading mentality right so one way to
play up dominance is just to lead and to command
in the bedroom this means that you should be the
leader and you should be the one that's initiating stuff
in the bedroom what does this mean this means that
you command and tell her what to do if you
want her to take her panties off you tell her
take your panties off in a kind of a dominating
authoritative tone right you're not so much asking a question
you're giving her a command also you're leading her around
so for example if you want to have sex with
her on the couch you take her and you lead
her to the couch if you want to have sex
with her on the bed you take her leader to
the bed maybe you even carry her to the bed
by picking her up like this and carrying her over
right I also be in charge of changing up sexual
positions so when you're having sex you're the guy who
is responsible for saying when to switch positions so if
you're having sex missionary for a few minutes then switch
to doggy after you've had sex doggy for five minutes
switch to something else then go slam her against the
wall then go have sex with her on the floor
then go have sex with there on the kitchen counter
you know whatever so just kind of do that and
then if you want to tie her up pull out
your tie and tie her up so your the one
who's leading all this stuff don't wait for her to
tell you what to do most girls will not do
anything in the bedrooms they'll just follow your lead so
make sure you're leading and commanding right be sure of
yourself when you're doing this stuff one thing that I
personally found in my own journey to get good at
this because you know I was very inexperienced with sex
not until that long ago and so and so one
of the things that I started was that you know
I was hesitant like I wasn't sure well what if
the girl rejects me like what if I go in
and kiss her and ask her for sex but then
she doesn't want to have sex or what if I
try to finger her but then she doesn't want to
get fingered or what if I am having doggy style
sex with her and I want to go into missionary
but I'm like oh well maybe she doesn't want to
go into missionary you know what you got to cut
all that [ __ ] out and you just got
to take off kind of a leadership role and just
assume that it's gonna work and ninety-nine percent of the
time it will work and she'll just go with you
and in fact she'll love the confidence with which you
execute right so as soon as a thought into your
smile your mind like oh I want to [ __
] her doggy style just go and do it don't
second-guess yourself don't ask yourself whether she's gonna like it
don't ask yourself how you're gonna look or whether it's
gonna be comfortable or even whether the position is gonna
work or not that's one that I got tripped up
on a lot is that I would say to myself
well what if this position isn't comfortable or what if
you know like she's too short for doggy style with
me or maybe she's too tall or whatever just go
try it right women will forgive you if you try
something with confidence and it doesn't work then you can
just say oh well it didn't work and you just
move on to the next thing and it's fine what
they won't forgive you for is when you're weak and
meek and you're hesitating and you're stuck in your head
and you're worrying and you're asking her if if she's
gonna like this or if she's gonna like that don't
do that stuff just do it assuming she's gonna like
it and in most cases she will and everything's gonna
come out great actually while I'm on this point this
really reminds me of a a really core kind of
uh philosophy that I want you to bring to the
bedroom in the bedroom you're the man and what you
are doing is that you're ravishing your girl that's how
I want you to be thinking about this you're gonna
ravish her so whatever comes to your mind you know
within reason whatever comes to your mind you just do
it right because this is an authentic expression of you
you're this penetrating force you're penetrating out with your dick
of course you are with your dick but even more
so with your mind and your intellect and your will
that's what you're really penetrating her with right you're [
__ ] her with your eyes you're [ __ ]
her with your commanding I will you're the boss so
be the boss so however you want to [ __
] her just [ __ ] her that way let
yourself go and just trust that it's gonna work out
now if you're if you're a really perverse far-out their
person you want to do some really kinky [ __
] with her that you might want to be a
little bit more hesitant with I'm talking about just basic
kind of stuff that's very normal in the bedroom right
normal sex positions and all the stuff I talked about
here most girls love love love this stuff so you
don't have to second-guess on this stuff now if you
want to like have her have sex with a donkey
that one you will have to go a little bit
slower on to see if she's gonna like that or
whatever so you know the basic stuff is uh is
all free for you to try without hesitation now what
I suggest here those were all the tips I had
for how to be dominant right so now what you've
got is you're left with all the tips for intimacy
and all the tips for dominance what I suggest now
is that you create what I call the sweet and
sour combo the sweetness our combo is when you say
something really intimate or you do something really intimate and
you follow it up with something really dominant so what's
an example of this well you might say something like
this intimacy hey baby I love you you know that
right and you look are deep in the eyes and
then right after you follow it up with dominant and
you say something like I'm gonna [ __ ] your
brains out like you're my dirty little [ __ ]
see you mix them together sweet kind of sour maybe
a little sweet and dominant or bitter or whatever you
want to call it and then you just keep that
dynamic going and you kind of alternate it throughout your
sex with her and that will turn out really really
good now the last element that really makes sex amazing
is variety variety surprise and adventure so don't be having
sex with her the same way all the time what
I recommend is that you start with my basic formula
and I've given here lots of different ideas for how
to spice up my basic formula my basic formula is
presented in part one of this video series part two
here we talked about a lot of ways that you
can customize stuff right you can spend the next year
practicing all this stuff and not master at all there's
so much stuff to try here you can't try all
this in one session you're gonna need to spread it
all out try different stuff you don't need to whip
out everything in one session right make sure you understand
that and basically what you do is you sprinkle it
around you change it around you customize it and you
create variety so that means that maybe one night is
a really deep intimate night and you have some like
slow steamy intimate sex another night is more of a
dominant animalistic you have sex with her in the you
know in the in the bar bathroom kind of sex
and that could be you know really nice way to
spice stuff up it can be a little surprising adventurous
then the next night you just might be a little
bit more kind of a mix between the two which
is kind of what I'm telling you here the standard
formula and you know you keep varying stuff up and
you change stuff up don't be having this the same
sex in the same positions all the time don't be
telling her the exact same things every single time you
have sex don't be having sex in the exact same
place all the time because sex can get old and
stale pretty quickly so you need be getting creative and
clever and need to be flexible and also you know
you just sprinkle in that variety deliberately this does not
happen accidentally you have to put some thought into have
to sometimes plan this stuff out you have to be
thinking about where you're gonna be when you're having sex
and do you have all the stuff you need there
and where can you take her to a new place
and this kind of stuff right so you're the man
you're kind of responsible for leading and setting the pace
and making sure that everything's in place that needs to
be in place for stuff to happen so wow you
know that's a lot of stuff there's so much stuff
here and there's a lot of more stuff that I
could talk about but this video is already running pretty
long so I think this gives you a lot of
very tangible things right I went out of my way
here to give you very concrete tangible things so you
can go out and practice right now and what I
hope here is I hope that you get the the
fundamental principles behind the little techniques the principles are very
simply intimacy dominance and then lastly variety those are really
the three principles that we're working with here so now
you can use these principles and you can find your
own specific techniques that you can add into the mix
that I gave you right you can find your own
ways to be intimate you can find your own clever
ways to be dominant and you can find your own
clever ways to add variety adventure into your sex so
go ahead and start practicing this stuff if you don't
know how to start well you need to start with
a girlfriend or someone have sex with it's hard to
practice this stuff on one-night stands because it's just such
an awkward situation you usually are pressed for time the
best way to practice is to get a girlfriend one
that's kind of sexually curious and adventurous and then just
start having lots of sex with her and at nighttime
you have sex but at daytime what you do is
you sit down and you actually plan what kind of
sex you want to have not with her but just
with yourself you can do it with her too but
just with your you know tell yourself oh well today
I want to go have sex with her in the
park and tomorrow I want to have some really intimate
sex with her and then the next day on the
weekend I want to tie her up and maybe do
some squirting or whatever just start playing around with it
and you'll find that you know after six to twelve
months of this kind of practice you're gonna become just
a connoisseur a master in the bedroom it doesn't take
that much practice to get really good right the most
important thing is that you're just curious you're open you
want to have a great experience you want to create
a great experience for yourself and for the girl and
that you actually like pleasing the knurl I think that
the problem that most guys have is that they just
don't care about pleasing the girl in the bedroom right
that's a big no-no with me for me the whole
point of this amazing sex is that I get to
create this amazing experience for her and I get to
see the smile on her face and then she wants
to please me and it's just like a win-win situation
and it just turns out amazing for the both of
us so I hope that this sparked some ideas in
