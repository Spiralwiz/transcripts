hey this is Leo for actualised org and today I
want to do a little video blog about the importance
of inner game towards developing your career if you are
one of those individuals that happens to really care about
their career and is developing their career especially if your
career is is skill based and it's something that you're
approaching as a long-term addition to your life where you're
really developing and you're you're striving towards a great position
career-wise over the long run and you know that it's
gonna take you years maybe even decades to develop that
kind of status and and prestige that you need to
be at the top of your field in whatever it
is you do whether you're you're a design or an
artist a programmer an engineer you know if you're doing
marketing or public relations or you're in politics whatever it
is if you're really building your career and that's something
that's important to you then I think inner game is
really critical and the way I want to talk about
this is talking about my career and how I approach
career development for myself because I really ran into some
some some real issues inner game issues that I think
tanked my first career so you may or may not
know but what I wanted to be since I was
a kid was I wanted to be a video game
designer and that was kind of my dream job in
my dream career and so I really worked pretty hard
at it I since I was like seven years old
I started studying that industry analyzing games really playing about
playing them thinking about them thinking about how to create
games that would that would sell well that would that
would resonate with the market that kind of stuff and
I was building up a skillset so becoming a game
designer was actually an interesting career choice because it's it
was it was kind of nebulous and abstract some of
the skills that I needed so you know I needed
good writing skills I needed good a good rounded knowledge
of history and culture because that just comes into play
when you're doing designs I also need a lot of
experience playing games I also needed art some sort of
a little bit of an art background I didn't need
to be good as an artist but I needed to
be able to to communicate with artists to understand what
is you know how aesthetics work and also understand like
art pipelines that kind of stuff and then I also
needed to understand a little bit of programming and coding
even though as a designer most of your time is
not spent coding there are there are parts of the
job where you could be doing coding or scripting but
also it helps to understand that because you're communicating with
programmers that are actually doing the coding in the game
and you want to make sure that your designs are
feasible that they don't take too much time or too
much programming effort to put forward so it helps to
have a lot of that knowledge also helps to have
like marketing knowledge helps to have business acumen to be
a good designer so a lot it's one of those
professions that that took a lot of pieces to come
together it's not just it's not as narrowly isolated as
let's say if you wanted to be a programmer that
would be a little bit a little bit less broad
a little bit more focused that's more technical field design
was more of an abstract field and so you know
I spent I spend a good 10 15 years developing
some skills in this in this department of design studying
all this stuff trying to improve my skills get better
and then when I got hired the challenge I found
was that I had some inner game challenges that were
really preventing me from for moving forward because what I
needed to do was I needed to start building my
my design my design intuition and my design capacity my
design portfolio and my design experience and all of that
required that I put in a lot of time doing
doing game design and and you know working my job
being stable at it and investing myself over the long
term that's kind of a concept known as building career
capital that means as you gain more experience in your
career that helps you to to be able to trade
up and have more value to offer to employers or
even if you're starting your own business to your customers
because your knowledge and your experience base and your skills
from that base is basically what you're using to create
whatever product is you're using to create so in my
case maybe like a game I'm using my skills and
turning that into a into a game that I'm then
selling to people or into design documents that I'm giving
to employers that are ultimately leading to a game that's
being sold and so that's how value is being generated
so the more skill I have the better that a
design I can put forward and the better I'll get
rewarded for it in the end ideally that's that's kind
of how the system is supposed to work but I
had some blocks that really prevented me from from doing
game design and ultimately I think it's because of my
lack of self awareness and self development that I that
I quit that industry whereas if I wanted to and
if I had more of that kind of information that
I have now since I quit I did a lot
of self-help and self development studying and if I had
that information you know five years ago or whatever when
I was when I was going through that process when
I had my game design job it would have been
a totally different experience because now I know best practices
for developing careers so what are some of those issues
I have some notes on it that I'm gonna reference
one of the you know one of the problems or
one of the ways that are really screwed up my
career was a general lack of patience and not seeing
not seeing the big picture I was very ambitious and
one of the things you know when I first got
my job was that I wanted advancement in my career
and looking back on it now it was an unrealistic
expectation for the amount of advancement that I wanted so
you know month I was thinking in terms of months
not years not decades I wanted to be able to
progress and get raises really fast I wanted to to
have impact so the designs of the work that I
was doing I wanted to to get that out to
the public really fast I wanted to for people in
the company to start taking notice of what I was
doing and I wanted that to be happening fast but
looking back now I understand that the pacing the end
the expectations that I had set for myself there we're
not very realistic so that's one of the like inner
game challenges that I had that could have easily been
worked out if I just had more awareness maybe if
I spoke to a coach about it or I just
had more self-development knowledge at that point so that another
another issue that I had was was lack of folk
so I think focus is very important when you're talking
about developing a career because that it is that your
career is happening over the long run right it's happening
over years and decades and so in that case you
can just consider all the different ways as you're pursuing
your path that you can get knocked off of it
by circumstances that you know more or less noise that
happens in your life so maybe a friend comes to
you with a great business idea while you're working on
your career and it seems lucrative and it seems great
and you're very tempted to jump on it that shows
a lack of focus like a commitment to what you're
doing not to say that you can never jump on
opportunities like that but one of the problems is that
if you're always jumping from one thing to the next
thing to the next thing and you're not consistent and
you're not building that kind of capital that you need
that massive amount of capital so that you can be
top of the field and you have more experience than
all your other competitors or anybody else that is in
your industry then you're it's gonna be hard to get
the same kind of success it's gonna hard to to
be able to produce the kind of products and services
that you want because you're not gonna have the experience
and knowledge to do it it's kind of hard to
be to be competing against people that have way more
experience in that kind of industry or field than you
do so if you do jump on that new business
idea make sure then that that is really what you
need to do and then you're gonna stick with that
new business idea it's really almost thinking of it as
a shift in career track and that that's literally what
happened to me is I had some good opportunities to
do internet marketing so I jumped on that and ended
up taking focus off of my career and I knew
at that time that that was a major shift and
that most likely I was leaving the industry forever but
still if I had more awareness again around that then
it would have been big and also I just started
noticing you know as I was running my own business
it was very easy to lose focus and to jump
from project to project to project without wrapping stuff up
without it but without finishing it up and being very
consistent and dedicated and in terms of the success that
you get in your life that dedication is just critical
being able to be dedicated and staying on path and
staying focused it's very very important so if you don't
develop those skills you don't recognize those pitfalls and you
want to go into your own business or you go
into a career and then you start wondering why you're
not getting the success that you want well maybe it's
because you're jumping around and you're dabbling and you're not
really investing or even if you're putting a lot of
time into it you're not investing it very judiciously so
you're not using it to really build up the core
skills that are providing the most value the core skills
that you're using to generate that value that you know
that your niche is known for so if you're a
designer you know it's just it's making great designs if
you're a programmer it's about maybe making complex programming systems
or whatever that core value is of what you're offering
so that was a big one getting more awareness around
that and dialing in my inner game for that I
just had to do it through trial and error where
it would have been much nicer to have somebody kind
of guide me through that stuff or at least to
have read some books about it before before before going
into into my first career another another problem that I
had was just like a feeling of an inadequacy when
I when I got to my job because when I
was working by myself and I was building up my
portfolio I felt I started to develop a confidence in
myself because I started creating little games little projects and
those projects started getting critical success they started getting some
good reception I saw that they they were good you
know based on my own standards and then what it
end up happening was that when I when I stepped
up and I moved up and I got hired by
you know by one of the best studios in the
world to do design for them all of a sudden
I was surrounded by by totally different a class class
of players and you know the people that I was
working with were really top-notch top-notch people and so it
started to really forced me to step up at the
same time I started to look around and I'm thinking
to myself like wow I still I realize you know
I thought that I was the but now I realize
that I have a long way to go there's still
so much that I have to learn I don't it's
like I thought I knew 50% of what I needed
to know and then when I moved up and I
started associating with people that were top notch in the
field I all of a sudden I felt like I
only knew five percent of what I needed to know
and so I started feeling inadequate and when you start
to feel inadequate acting from a position if inadequacy causes
all sorts of problems it can cause office politics problems
can cause um you know problems with your higher-ups your
underlings can cause problems with coworkers it can also just
kind of shake you and leave you feeling bad about
where you are where in fact if you take a
larger scale of view of how you're progressing you might
actually be exactly where you need to be you might
just be on the right track but if you're very
impatient kind of the way that I was and you
were expecting to get a lot for a little than
what ends up happening is that that inadequacy starts to
cause doubts starts to get you thinking like well maybe
I should be doing more maybe I should be starting
my own business maybe I should be doing side projects
maybe I should be staying in the office and working
later and all this kind of stuff which can lead
to very sorts of problems that can backfire on you
if you start working too hard maybe you'll burn out
if you start undertaking your own projects maybe those will
conflict with the stuff you're doing at work if you
start your own business obviously that might conflict with what
you're doing at work it'll take time away again that
idea of shift it'll shift focus in a different direction
so now all of a sudden instead of focusing on
pure game design which is what I was doing at
work now all of a sudden when I start my
own business I just spent a lot of my time
focusing on on other aspects of business so now no
longer am i spending 90% of my time doing design
I'm spending maybe 10% of my time doing design and
I mean spending 20% doing programming 20% doing art to
another 20% doing marketing and then another 10% doing finance
and then the question is what what is the best
investment of my time long term if I want to
be lets say a designer is it to be spreading
out my energy and spreading it out across art and
programming in business and marketing all this stuff and maybe
it maybe the answer is yes because actually as a
designer getting a little bit of your feet wet and
getting experience in all those is good but then on
the other hand there's also something to be said about
just being a really good designer and focusing all your
time energy on that because usually when a company hires
you or an employee or an employer hires you or
even if you're doing a business being very specialized and
having a very specialized skill set that nobody else has
is a very good way to extract value and to
get a lot for you know in exchange for your
services so if if you're the top notch programmer that
knows how to you know how to program pixel shaders
and you're the best in the world at that then
some company that needs to to to make awesome pixel
shaders will hire you because you're the best in the
world and they'll pay you a premium for that because
you're better than everybody else they're paying you a premium
for your experience because that's that's a scarce commodity whereas
if you're just a generalist programmer that dabbled in all
sorts of different areas of programming and all the sudden
you go applying for a job well how many dabbler
programmers are there there's a lot but there's not only
a lot of those there's also a lot of programmers
that are very good in very specific areas so usually
a company has a specific role that they want a
programmer to take so maybe it's you know it's a
graphics maybe it's a it's AI maybe it's a you
know system architecture or whatever it is or gameplay mechanics
or networking so usually if they have that role they're
gonna prefer to hired expert so if they want you
know a networking programmer they're gonna go hire a networking
program they're not gonna hire a jack-of-all-trades because that networking
programmer is just more specialized and the trend in society
is that you know as society gets more and more
complexed niches become more and more focused and specialization becomes
more more more and more of a valued commodity so
so in that sense understanding all these things and getting
my my game my inner game dialed in I think
would have really helped me looking back now too to
be more at peace at where I was when I
started my job and to really sustained it and to
have invested in it in a very smart way that
ultimately the way I see it now like if I
went back and I read through the whole thing with
the knowledge that I have now of self-development and the
inner game that I've built up in the inner game
that I could build up if I could build up
specific to game design if I wanted to I could
really position myself over the next like five or ten
years to be to be a highly valued well-paid designer
in that industry if that's something that I chose you
know I found a better purpose for myself now so
they have even more excited about which is which is
coaching a self-development but just thinking back I think it
is a great example of how if you're if you're
somebody who really cares about your career figuring out how
to dial in your inner game and take out all
the inner blocks that you might have that keep you
from being fully engaged in it and from fully investing
in it in the long term and stuff that keeps
you agitated stuff that is causing you consistent problems maybe
with coworkers or with your confidence or your ability to
stay on track and keep focused like these kinds of
things and just get you more excited to reconnect you
with it to make your career path more sustainable maybe
you're burning yourself out through how hard you're working at
it so maybe more sustainability there so that you're able
to invest over a longer period of time more efficiently
and that puts you in a very powerful position eventually
that will allow you to earn those big bucks to
get that big paycheck have that kind of impact that
you want to have with your career and and really
get the respect that you will automatically reset when you
are at the top of your field not because you
have some social connections or because you knew the right
people but just because you have the skills and the
knowledge that are so valuable that very few other people
have you
