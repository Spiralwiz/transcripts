            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/8Jbvik4IA3o' target='_blank'>What Is Perception - The Metaphysics Of Perception</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding Perception</b>: Perception refers to the sensory bubble/visual field that we use to interact with reality. It implies a subject-object duality where the subject is the perceiver and the object is what is being perceived. Without a subject, perception or experience cannot exist.
</li><li><b>Perception without a Perceiver</b>: Leo asks the audience to imagine an experience or perception existing without an observer. If possible, the raw data of the experience would stay the same but the context would drastically change. This could lead to seeing the experience as universal, belonging not to a specific creature or entity, but to the universe itself.
</li><li><b>Existence of Objects in an Empty Universe</b>: Leo discusses how the universe can register the existence of objects without sentient beings. He outlines the conventional model of reality, consisting of an objective external world, two types of objects, sentient beings perceiving the external world, and the brain producing the perceptual field.
</li><li><b>The Illusion of the External Material World</b>: Individuals are not physical objects but ideas. The ego interprets and takes ownership of a field of consciousness, creating a perceptual reality bubble. People often mistake their perceptions as an objective external world when in actuality, they are merely interacting with their perceptual bubble.
</li><li><b>Ownership and Identity Created by the Mind</b>: Our sense of ownership and identity created by our minds are not reality, but projections. Perception not happening to a biological creature but float in empty space.
</li><li><b>Recontextualization and Collapse of Boundaries in Non-Duality</b>: Our perception of reality has been mistaken as the perceptions of a biological creature. Either the external world is not real and never existed, or the internal world is not real and never existed.
</li><li><b>Being Defined as Perception Minus The Ego</b>: Our perception of the world is subjective and created by our brains, but what we thought was internal is actually external. The external world is not hidden from us, but rather our internal world is open and not hidden.
</li><li><b>Perceptions and Experience are Illusions</b>: Created by the ego's interpretation of being. By undoing this identification with the ego, perceptions and experiences can be returned to a state of pure being.
</li><li><b>Being as Existing without Being Perceived</b>: Leo uses the analogy of a sponge to represent the entire reality. The bubbles are illusions, and the true reality is the empty space that unifies all the bubbles.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment Through Realizing Universal Interconnectedness</b>: By grounding ourselves in actuality and observing our own experiences, we can shift our perception to understand the interconnectedness of all.
</li><li><b>Awareness of the Visual Field</b>: Leo urges viewers to become aware of their visual field and realize it's not a biological part of them, but the universal fabric.
</li><li><b>True Nature of Reality Stripped of Ego's Perception</b>: The absolute truth does not involve any external changes but is the realization that the self is an illusion and that reality is pure truth.
</li><li><b>Survival Based on Deception</b>: Survival is based on deceptions, and the fear of questioning reality deeply stems from a fear of death. Understanding this transforms our relationships and perception of life.
</li><li><b>Self-Awareness</b>: Despite the assumption that it is limited to living creatures, self-awareness is possible. Awareness is not a property of biological creatures but an aspect of existence that is often ungraspable.
</li><li><b>Universe Consists of Raw Data without Perception</b>: Leo discusses the existence of an alternate universe of raw data without any awareness or perception. Truth just is, and cannot be fully understood or described with language or concepts.
</li><li><b>Perceptions are Integral to Understanding the Universe</b>: Everything, including psychedelic experiences and intake of medication, is ultimately a perception. These perceptions form a unified field of consciousness, constantly changing and creating the illusion of individual existence.
</li><li><b>Transforming Perception Through Interpretation and Focused Meditation</b>: The process of transforming one's perception and realizing they are the entire universe is a profound truth that requires going through fears, neuroses, ego, and surrendering judgments and arrogance.
</li><li><b>Exploring Fundamental Questions</b>: Leo is passionate about exploring fundamental questions about happiness, suffering, being a good human being, and the nature of reality. He believes that understanding these concepts is essential in creating a fulfilling and meaningful life.
</li><li><b>Perception and inexistence of sentient beings</b>: Leo Gura proposes a thought experiment asking viewers to imagine an object existing in an entirely empty universe without any sentient creatures to perceive it. He challenges the conventional belief that the universe contains and keeps a record of all objects, such as asteroids, even if there is no sentient entity to perceive these objects. This leads to the paradox of an existence that is unperceived and unknown, raising profound metaphysical questions.
</li><li><b>Existing view on reality</b>: Gura summarizes the existing conception of reality, a majority of people believe in: an external, objective material world that exists independently of sentient creatures, including us. Humans, as sentient objects, perceive this external world, creating individual perceptual fields. We classify objects as sentients and non-sentients and assume our perceptual field is produced by our brains, which are a part of the external world.
</li><li><b>Actual workings of reality</b>: Contrary to the existing view, Gura posits that the only thing that exists is a universal field of consciousness, and we, humans, are but ideas. These ideas suddenly take ownership of the field of consciousness, creating an illusion of an external world that exists independently. We incorrectly believe that this world is the reality behind our perception and construct our sense of selfhood from this illusion.
</li><li><b>Ownership and Identity</b>: The concept of ownership and identity are projections of the mind and not objective properties of the universe. As an analogy, Gura refers to a child that receives a toy, starts referring to it as 'mine', even though the toy itself remains unchanged. Similarly, the perceptual bubble we operate in is not inherently ours, but our mind projects the sense of ownership onto it.
</li><li><b>Negative Sculpture analogy</b>: Gura uses the analogy of a 'negative sculpture' to describe our existence. Instead of being objects that came into existence, we are more accurately 'holes' or 'spaces' carved out of the universal field of consciousness. Our perceived existence, therefore, is not real but a construct of a self within this field of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Concept of Perception Without You</b>: According to Leo Gura, the concept of perception remains unchanged even when devoid of a you. The colors, shapes, and sounds that constitute reality still exist. The difference arises in perceiving these elements not as experiences happening to a biological entity, but rather as experiences floating in the vacuum of empty space. This shift in perspective might be counterintuitive, as it contradicts the widely accepted conventional model of perception.
</li><li><b>Radical Recontextualization of Perception</b>: Gura's explanation invites a radical reinterpretation of how individuals perceive reality. It argues that perceptions are not experiences of a biological organism; instead, the existence of such a biological entity is an illusion. This perspective brings about two possible interpretations; either the external world is unreal and never existed, or the internal world is unreal and never existed. Either way, what was considered the internal or external world doesn't change at the sensory level; only the interpretation does.
</li><li><b>Non-duality and the Collapse of Boundaries</b>: Gura explains the concept of non-duality wherein all boundaries, dualities, and categories must collapse. This idea extends to our perception of reality, collapsing the duality between the subject and object. It suggests that all that exists is raw data, which we are mistakenly interpreting as our individual, subjective experiences tied to our biological selves.
</li><li><b>Change in Definitions of External and Internal Worlds</b>: In light of the aforementioned recontextualization, the definitions of 'external' and 'internal' worlds undergo a shift. Instead of an inaccessible, behind-the-scenes 'external world' and an open, 'internal world', the 'internal world' is proposed to be non-existent and all that ever was, was the 'external world', originally misconstrued as the 'internal world'. 
</li><li><b>Interpretation and its Radical Influence</b>: Gura emphasizes the significance of interpretation, stating that it's a life-altering element. A radical reinterpretation of our existence could lead to ceasing to exist 'within' the experience or 'behind' the perception, leaving only a world of raw data or 'being'.
</li><li><b>Difference between Perception and Being</b>: Gura distinguishes between 'perception' or 'experience' (synonymous in this context) and 'being'. Being is described as 'perception minus ego' or 'experience minus ego. In contrast, 'perception' or 'experience' is 'being plus ego'. Thus, when the subject, or the 'you', is removed from perception, it reverts back to being. 
</li><li><b>Analogy of the Sponge</b>: Gura utilizes the analogy of a sponge full of bubbles to illustrate the 'unified field of consciousness'. Each bubble inside the sponge represents a perception or experience whereas the sponge in its entirety is 'being' or the universal existence. This analogy supports the idea of interconnectedness and oneness in the universe.
</li><li><b>Perception as bubbles in a sponge</b>: In this part, Leo Gura uses the analogy of a sponge filled with bubbles to describe perception. Each of us, he says, is a bubble within this sponge, and we've spent our lives believing that our personal bubble is separate, generated by an organism or a brain in the perceived external world. Gura emphasizes that there is no subject  only the sponge (which here represents reality), and nobody is perceiving the sponge or reality; it simply "is".
</li><li><b>Being without a perceiver</b>: Gura elaborates on the concept of "being"  something that just "is" without anybody looking at it, interpreting it, or experiencing it. This eradicates personal interpretations, considerably altering the understanding of perception. 
</li><li><b>The sponge and the confines of time and space</b>: Leo makes clear that the sponge  reality  doesn't exist within confines of time and space, nor is it bound by physical or logical laws. These limitations, Gura posits, only exist within individual bubbles (our personal perceptions), and vary among bubbles. 
</li><li><b>The sponge's infinite nature</b>: Transitioning from three dimensions to an infinite number, Gura portrays the sponge as infinite, without boundaries or limitations. He elaborates that this realization that we are not mere bubbles, but the infinite sponge itself, constitutes enlightenment or "God consciousness."
</li><li><b>The illusory nature of bubbles</b>: In a deeper explanation of the sponge and bubbles analogy, Leo clarifies that the bubbles (representing our individual perspectives) are not real; they are illusory and do not have any essence of their own. All the bubbles, and thus all our perceptions and perspectives, are unified in the shared space of the sponge, emphasizing his understanding of one universal consciousness or "oneness".
</li><li><b>Encouraging self-realization</b>: Gura concludes this section of his presentation by encouraging the viewers to actually experience the shift he's describing  moving from perceiving themselves as individual bubbles, or entities, to recognizing themselves as part of the infinite sponge. He states that becoming aware that the external world is not separate but constitutes our own perceptual field is key to understanding this non-dualistic perspective. His expertise suggests that this shift, while challenging to achieve, ushers in an enlightened state of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Subjectivity of Perception</b>: The video explores the concept of subjectivity in perception, suggesting that one's interaction with the universe through sensory experiences like colors, shapes, and emotions is not subjective to biological organisms, but intrinsic to the universe itself. Leo asserts that such qualities aren't happening to the individual but rather happening within the universe itself, independent of one's perception.
</li><li><b>Absolute Being or Pure Truth</b>: The video emphasizes that the ultimate truth or absolute being is the raw experience of the universe stripped of personal perspective or the idea of 'self'. It clarifies that the quest for enlightenment is not about a change in external experiences, rather a radical reinterpretation of existing experiences, whereby the individual realizes that the concept of self is an illusion.
</li><li><b>Survival and Fear of Death</b>: The video outlines that the difficulty in achieving enlightenment arises from the inherent drive for survival and the fear of death. The fear of losing one's identity or concept of 'self' causes various emotional and psychological reactions.
</li><li><b>The Realization of God and the Illusion of Self</b>: Leo insists that understanding Absolute Being and the quest for enlightenment revolves around the profound realization that the individual 'self' is merely an illusional concept. The universe's perception or awareness does not necessitate a perceiving entity.
</li><li><b>The Universe's Self-Awareness</b>: Leo challenges the commonly held belief that awareness is a characteristic exclusive to living creatures. It is proposed instead that awareness is a fundamental, mysterious aspect of the universe itself that is irreducible and not easily explained by science or philosophy. There are no sentient creatures as such but merely an interconnected field of perceptions within the universal whole.
</li><li><b>Awareness is characterized as nothingness</b>: Awareness is not a thing or a product of the brain but more referred to a state of being or existence in which perceptions are stimulated. It's a void or a vacuum and doesn't technically exist. Any attempts to describe it usually veer into the mystical and are often incorrect.
</li><li><b>The role of the brain in perceptions</b>: Neuroscience has mistakenly assumed the brain to be something more fundamental than a perception. While the brain is indeed a perception, adjustments to it can have broad changes to other perceptions. Damaging the brain, for instance, can lead to changes in our sensory processing like vision, smell, etc. 
</li><li><b>Alternate Universe without awareness</b>: A hypothetical alternate universe where awareness doesn't exist is proposed. This universe only contains factual or object-based realities, devoid of any perception or feelings. This is compared to the current universe that consists of raw truth, facts, or data happening to nobody; it's 'being' in the purest form.
</li><li><b>Perception is a form of 'being'</b>: The use of the term perception here is an analogy for 'being'. All the perceptions, including the brain itself, interact with one another in various ways, sometimes causing local and sometimes global effects. This interaction of perceptions forms a Unified Field of Consciousness, which is constantly changing and interacting with itself.
</li><li><b>Challenging perceptions through focus and practice</b>: By becoming focused on the present moment, quieting the mind through meditation, yoga, or even conscientiously used psychedelics, one can challenge their existing perceptions and potentially realize the nature of being, or 'Absolute Truth.' This requires a reinterpretation of reality and might demand months or years of disciplined practice.
</li><li><b>Perception and the illusion of sentient creatures</b>: Known organisms or sentient beings are just illusions or "negative sculptures" in the Unified Field. Perception is not owned by sentient beings; instead, it exists as the 'truth' or 'being'. The difficulty in comprehending this concept stems from the tendency to relate all experiences to the self, which creates a misinterpretation of absolute being.
</li><li><b>Final assertions of Leo</b>: Leo affirms this acknowledgment isn't derived from fiction or baseless beliefs, but an actual realization through correct interpretation and focused meditation. The attainment of such truth requires dedication and time, but the result is the understanding of Absolute Truth or 'being', beyond the perspective of any sentient creature.
</li><li><b>Relevance of the episode before a trip</b>: Before embarking on any significant journey, Gura suggests revisiting and contemplating on the insights shared in this episode for deeper awareness.
</li><li><b>Resolving the mind-body problem</b>: The enduring philosophical issue of the mind-body problem is ultimately resolved by perceiving oneself as not just a part of the universe, but as the entire universe. Gura insists that he doesn't claim any special credit for this; he merely hopes to explain it in a way that resonates with modern audiences.
</li><li><b>Repackaging ancient wisdom</b>: Actualized.org essentially repackages timeless truths that have been known for over 5,000 years by mankind. The platform aims to present these long-established ideas in a manner that is relevant and engaging for a contemporary audience.
</li><li><b>Work and emotional difficulty</b>: Gura emphasizes that the process of altering one's perception and understanding of life necessitates a lot of hard work and emotional introspection.
</li><li><b>Transformation through inquiry</b>: Gura reiterates that going through with the process of inquiry adequately can lead to a transformative life experience that completely alters one's overall perception system.
</li><li><b>Attaining profound joy</b>: By surrendering ego and other mental obstacles, a person can achieve supreme joy, described as unparalleled and beyond human imagination.
</li><li><b>The ordeal of realizing universal selfhood</b>: Gura notes that the process to realize oneself as the universe is a challenging ordeal, albeit with a reward of profound joy and bliss. It requires surrendering ego, arrogance, judgment, and opening the mind radically.
</li><li><b>Creating a comprehensive catalogue</b>: Gura projects his platform, actualized.org, as an effort to create a comprehensive catalogue of deep explanations about fundamental elements and questions of life.
</li><li><b>Passionate about exploring metaphysical topics</b>: Despite acknowledging that some audiences might find the content metaphysical or impractical, Gura contends that addressing these subjects is of paramount importance. He assures that practical advice on diverse topics, such as confidence and self-esteem, will also be released in the future.
</li><li><b>Purpose and future projection</b>: Gura outlines his purpose which is to address the lack of in-depth information available on certain crucial topics. He aims to create a catalogue of videos providing deep-dive explanations of these subjects, with the hope that this resource will transform someone's life.
