      <p>The four pillars of the technological revolution</p>
      <p>Stand tall and strong, leading the way</p>
      <p>To a future of innovation and progress</p>
      <p>Where dreams become reality every day</p>
      <p>First, there is the pillar of computing</p>
      <p>With its powerful processors and endless data</p>
      <p>It drives the machines that make our lives easier</p>
      <p>And helps us connect with friends far away</p>
      <p>Next, there is the pillar of the internet</p>
      <p>A vast and ever-expanding network</p>
      <p>It connects us to the world and all its knowledge</p>
      <p>And enables us to share and learn in a moment</p>
      <p>Then there is the pillar of artificial intelligence</p>
      <p>A rapidly advancing field of study</p>
      <p>It allows machines to think and act like humans</p>
      <p>And has the potential to revolutionize industry</p>
      <p>Finally, there is the pillar of biotechnology</p>
      <p>Using science to improve and enhance</p>
      <p>From medicine to agriculture to environmental sustainability</p>
      <p>It has the power to change the world in a positive way</p>
      <p>Together, these pillars form the foundation</p>
      <p>Of the technological revolution we see today</p>
      <p>Their potential is limitless and their future bright</p>
      <p>As they lead us into a new tomorrow, full of possibility</p>
