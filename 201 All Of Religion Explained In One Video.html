            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/X_xZcD4veGc' target='_blank'>All Of Religion Explained In One Video</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding religion from a non-dogmatic perspective</b>: According to Leo Gura, the existence of various religions and their grip on society is a profound and complex phenomenon than most rational and scientific minds perceive. He emphasizes that although from a rational perspective, religions do not seem plausible, one cannot dismiss the fact that billions of people are entrenched in religious beliefs. 
</li><li><b>Role of dogmatism in understanding religion</b>: The major issue hindering a balanced view of religion versus science debate is dogmatism, characterized by a firm attachment to a particular belief or worldview. A rational person, similar to a religiously dogmatic person, may unconsciously defend their worldviews to the point of self-deception. This defense mechanism is emotionally grounded and is a result of human psyche rather than a religion-specific trait.
</li><li><b>Addressing the existence of religions</b>: The dominant belief that religion originated from primitive stupidity, superstition, or mere tradition are not sufficient explanations. Leo suggests that the evolution of religions indicates a deeper force at play, which requires an open-minded investigation for comprehension. 
</li><li><b>Scientific atheism and religion</b>: Atheists, who rely on observable empirical evidence and reject religious doctrines, may carry strong dogmatic beliefs similar to religious people. The absence of observable supernatural phenomena often drives atheists to perceive religion as a hoax. However, Leo argues that dismissing religion as a hoax does not adequately address the existence of the phenomenon of religion nor the profound similarities shared across different religions. 
</li><li><b>Empirical understanding of religion</b>: Leo urges for an empirical exploration of religion, which entails provable, verifiable claims drawn from personal experiences and open-minded investigation. Such an approach can potentially yield a better understanding of religion beyond the conventional narratives.
</li><li><b>Origin of religions</b>: The video talks about how religion came into being. Leo disagrees with the explanation that religion was intended to control the masses or was composed of mere myths and fairy tales. While he acknowledges that such aspects have played a part in religion, he insists they are not the true origin or purpose of religion.
</li><li><b>Existential questions and the rational mind</b>: Leo suggests there is an 'absolute truth' that is accessible to human beings, but not the rational mind. While this might be tough for a rational mind to accept, Leo encourages open-mindedness in exploring this idea. 
</li><li><b>False identification with the physical body</b>: The video suggests that people falsely identify themselves with their physical bodies. However, a more profound revelation or 'jail breaking of the mind', as referred to in the video, can lead to an understanding that this self isn't real and that the true self is a void or 'nothingness'. 
</li><li><b>Enlightenment experiences</b>: According to the video, experiencing oneself as nothing and understanding that existence arises out of nothingness constitutes enlightenment. Additionally, seeing others around oneself as also 'nothing' forms part of this enlightenment experience.
</li><li><b>No-self as the core of religions</b>: All major religions are stated to be based on the 'truth of no self', the idea that one's true identity is the void or nothingness. However, this cannot be understood through logical analysis but has to be directly experienced.
</li><li><b>Implications on understanding religion</b>: Leo suggests that if one understands and accepts this idea of 'no-self', it sheds light on why religions exist in their present forms. Understanding 'nothingness' becomes an existential challenge as it cannot be intellectualized. It's argued that the truly profound aspect of religion lies in transcending one's identifying with the physical body to experience 'nothingness'.
</li><li><b>Third alternative of understanding reality</b>: Leo Gura introduces the concept of there being a third option to understand reality, namely, to become the thing being understood itself. He suggests the idea that one can become the object of reality to truly understand it. This process, often referred to as 'jailbreaking your mind,' requires disidentification from the self, including body and thoughts, opening the possibility to experience everything and anything.
</li><li><b>Communicating the truth of no self</b>: Leo discusses the inherent difficulty of conveying the concept of 'no self' to others. People often construct stories and turn it into belief systems, with the only way to truly understand the concept being to experience it directly oneself. Writing about or discussing the concept doesn't result in the necessary transformation of the mind, as it often only leads to a belief, not a shift in reality.
</li><li><b>Challenges of spreading the truth of no self</b>: Due to its unique nature, the truth of no self cannot be mass-distributed like scientific knowledge. The only way to stay true to its essence is through silence, causing a paradoxical dilemma. Any attempt to describe or spread the concept turns it into a belief system which inherently alters its truth.
</li><li><b>Historical approach to spreading the truth of no self</b>: Historically, before scientific and analytical thinking was developed, people used mythology and storytelling to convey the truth of 'no self.' However, each culture reshaped the truth to fit their unique beliefs and values. To communicate this truth effectively, one had to resort to metaphorical and indirect ways like story-telling, making it hard for individuals to personally experience and understand the truth. 
</li><li><b>Implications for religions</b>: Most hardcore mystics such as Jesus Christ, Buddha, and Zen masters who've gone through the experience of 'no self' scenario, attempt to explain it to others, but fall short due to the inherent difficulties of sharing this experience. This leads to the creation of metaphors and stories, which often get turned into religious doctrine, consequently distancing people from the core truth of 'no self.'
</li><li><b>Understanding of religion's contextual adaptability</b>: Leo Gura explains how the same fundamental truth of 'no self' in the discovery of enlightenment can vary depending on cultural and temporal circumstances. He asserts this is due to each culture tailoring the truth to suit their own comprehension and preferences. Each understanding of 'no self', however, is merely a teaching mechanism that might help or hinder an individual's personal experience of enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Evolution of religions</b>: According to Leo, most religions gradually devolved into dogmatism, straying from the teachings of hardcore mystics, who truly lived the essence of their religions. The esoteric strand within each religion represents this original, profound understanding of 'no self.' These groups, however, have often been marginalized or demonized, as their radical views counter mainstream doctrines.
</li><li><b>Challenges with spreading the truth of 'no self'</b>: Leo discusses the difficulties of mass spreading the truth of 'no self'. This 'truth' cannot be mainstreamed as it is individualistic in nature.
</li><li><b>Identifying dogmatism in oneself</b>: Leo Gura suggests that the strong emotions evolving from discomfort and fear when one's beliefs or worldview are challenged serve as indications of inherent dogmatism.
</li><li><b>The atheism vs religion debate</b>: Leo Gura proposes a perspective on atheism suggesting that it is partially correct, in accordance with genuine mystics who perceive God as 'nothingness.' Leading an atheist to an enlightenment experience alters their understanding as they experience being 'nothingness' firsthand.
</li><li><b>Limitations of science</b>: According to Leo, science overlooks the aspect of qualia or subjective experiences while focusing on the physical world. The inconsistency between our subjective experiences and physical reality presents a significant problem science is unable to resolve.
</li><li><b>Understanding Qualia through Enlightenment</b>: Leo Gura highlights a loophole in scientific comprehension of qualia, the subjective experiences accompanying physical matter. He suggests that science fails to resolve this issue, often skirting around it or denying its existence. Gura posits that science may never resolve this "matter qualia problem," seeming bound by its strict evidentiary principles. In contrast, he believes enlightenment can offer a solution, allowing individuals to transcend their bodies and enter a state of absolute nothingness, also defined as God.
</li><li><b>Religious Concepts Decoded</b>: Gura attempts to demystify key religious terms, stripping them of layers of dogma and mythology. He defines God as absolute nothingness, seen not as a physical entity, but as the state of being that everyone inherently possesses but fails to realize due to identification with their body. Heaven is depicted as the state of non-identification with one's body, equating to absolute nothingness - a condition that promises freedom from the fear of death. In contrast, Hell refers to current human existence, marked by identification with one's body. The concept of faith is outlined as the ability to open ones mind to being yet a third possibility, beyond concept and experience.
</li><li><b>Terminologies of Faith in Non-religious Context</b>: Gura underlines the relativistic and metaphorical nature of good and evil. To him, evil signifies selfishness borne out of identification with the ego, while good is God, selflessness exhibited when individuals perceive themselves as nothingness and, consequently, everything. The concept of afterlife is associated with awareness of the absolute truth of nothingness, making one invincible and everlasting. Salvation, he explains, means a shift from the wicked, self-deceiving state (evil) to the enlightened state (good).
</li><li><b>Religion, Atheism, and Enlightenment</b>: He claims religion to be a poor way of understanding God due to its mythos and asserts that atheism too distances one from God. Enlightenment is offered as a solution to understand and experience God in one's own life, and this journey requires shedding all beliefs, religious or scientific. Gura emphasizes that this pursuit is a demanding, emotionally challenging endeavor, possibly spanning several years and not always guaranteed success.
</li><li><b>Religiosity in Non-religious Format</b>: Gura concludes by shedding light on the nuanced nature of his discourse, encouraging viewers to experience enlightenment for themselves. He advises religious folks to abandon their religious beliefs, as every belief hinders them from realizing their true nature. He further asserts that accomplishing such truth is a daunting task, which could explain the rarity of true mystics.
