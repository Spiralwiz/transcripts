[Music] it's time for us to get serious about this
work one of the biggest challenges with the topics that
we talk about on this channel is that I cover
a lot of highly abstract theoretical and conceptual topics which
can get people lost into this sort of rabbit hole
of theory and ideas and failing to distinguish between that
and what all these concepts and ideas are pointing to
so we need to get out of fantasy out of
concepts and out of imagination and into the real world
in touch with what is actual actual actuality what is
actual so today we're going to be working on carving
out this distinction this is one of the most important
distinctions you can make in all of personal development and
in all of spiritual work is this distinction between on
the one hand the actual what is actual and then
on the other hand concepts beliefs and imagination and people
in general are very very poor at distinguishing between these
two and this is why they get themselves into so
much epistemic trouble and they struggle so much to understand
reality is because they've completely blurred this distinction such that
they're living in augmented reality this sort of conceptual matrix
which is interpreting everything that they're seeing all their interactions
with actuality are getting corrupted by all of their concepts
that they got from their culture and from their early
upbringing and now they can't tell the two apart so
let's work to correct this a really common mistake that
people make when they think about spirituality is they think
that all spirituality that's like a bunch of beliefs when
in fact spirituality is the exact opposite of that spirituality
is actuality not belief so let's get you in touch
with that right now actuality what do we mean when
we say the word actual so we could sit here
and think about it I can give you a bunch
of interesting theories and ideas about what it all means
and how it all works and none of that will
actually get you closer to actuality so this is a
very hands-on episode no pun intended where you're going to
have to participate with me here to actually get this
not just listen to me but actually do the exercises
we're gonna do a lot of exercises here so let's
do this right now take out your hand and look
at it hold it in front of your face about
a foot away from you and just look at your
hand put your awareness completely on your hand without a
bunch of distracting thoughts and just look at it notice
the hands existence the fact that it exists in your
direct experience and just sit with that don't particularly try
to do anything or get anywhere or have any kind
of objective just be with your hand and recognize and
be conscious of its existence make sure you're actually doing
this as I'm talking pause this recording if you need
to to make sure that you get what I'm saying
and I want you to hit this sort of moment
where you become hyper conscious of the fact that oh
yes this hand exists here it is and just be
hyper conscious of its existence that right there is actuality
your hand actual here it is don't fall into the
trap of thinking oh well so what who cares Leo
this is so obvious no no no it's not obvious
at all not obvious at all sit here and just
be conscious of this hand be conscious of its actuality
this is what's real this is as close to reality
as you can get there is no closer no amount
of science or religion or reading books or hearing lectures
or watching videos will ever get you closer to reality
than looking at your hand right now that's as close
as you can get if you can't get this you're
lost there's no hope for you you can't do consciousness
work you can't do spirituality you can't do personal development
if you can't get this that's how important this is
now take your hand put it behind your back so
you can't see it anymore and now imagine and think
of your hand that right there is concept and imagination
we're going to be using the word concept and imagination
throughout this episode interchangeably so do you get that don't
think about this I want you to actually experience it
to feel it now take your hand out again look
at it and notice that this is actual this is
actuality right here and then when I put it away
and I think about it that is concept and imagination
are you getting this make sure you do this a
couple of times to make the distinction very clear it's
not enough that you understand the distinction conceptually that's easy
any fool can do that you have to actually experience
it and become very quick at distinguishing between these two
as it's happening throughout your entire life all the time
when you are waking up in the morning when you're
brushing your teeth when you're tired when you're hungry when
you're horny when you're depressed when you're angry when you're
frustrated all of these things are happening to you you
need to be able to recognize between what is actual
and what is imaginary otherwise you're gonna blur these two
and get yourself into a lot of trouble and it's
going to be utterly impossible for you to do any
kind of work towards enlightenment or basically any spirituality because
spirituality is not about about a bunch of rule beliefs
about spirits and aliens and ghosts and things like that
spirituality is this right here this exercise that we're doing
right now looking at your hand look at your hand
right now look at that hand that is as close
to spirituality as you will ever get are you getting
this I'm not joking you might say olio but how
can my hand what what is spiritual about my hand
are you we just playing word games here why are
you calling my hands spiritual there's nothing spiritual about this
this is just some ordinary perception that I have ah
you see you're not being careful you're not being careful
because look what your mind is doing your mind is
saying this is a hand it's a human hand it's
biological it's mad of chemicals and molecules and it's physical
and it's it's my hand and the label hand is
getting applied to it and you're calling it my experience
my perceptions see this is a lot of conceptual baggage
that you're adding on top of what's here what is
actually occurring right here is not so obvious and the
problems that your mind is so used to projecting it's
interpretations on to everything that you're seeing all the time
that again you're failing to distinguish between actuality and then
what your mind is coming up with and thinking is
there what you think is there isn't actually there so
this hand that you think is there this physical hand
it seems like that's what's actual but that's not what
act is what is what is actual so what's happening
is that your mind is giving context to every perception
that you're having even to say that a thing is
a perception or an experience is already to go too
far it's already to give way too much conceptual context
to this thing that's happening right here already way too
far so really what spirituality is about is about deep
contextualizing everything that you experience or see or feel such
that you get it as close to as raw as
possible without any interpretations and then you see what happens
and you might be surprised at what happens if you're
just starting with this exercise it might seem to you
like well Lea if I just sit here and I
look at my hand I mean isn't just don't isn't
this just a waste of time I mean what's gonna
happen seems like nothing's gonna happen I'm just gonna sit
here and look at it it's kind of obvious and
okay so what next what do we do next tell
me something flashy and and mind-blowing no no no this
right here is what's mind-blowing but you gotta really sit
here and look at it look at it for a
long time I spend about five hours a week at
least these days just sitting and looking at my hand
this is my favorite spiritual exercise this is my favorite
meditation technique I've sort of outgrow and various other kinds
of techniques like for me now just it's so simple
that I just I sit on my couch I just
look at my hand like this literally like this for
an hour and then I get up and do other
stuff and I do that maybe five times a week
and that's five hours right there if just looking my
hand that's it that's the entire spiritual practice that's us
as a pure of a spiritual practices you're ever gonna
get forget about yoga forget about enlightenment forget about self
inquiry and all this complicated you're getting lost in way
too much conceptual stuff right you got to make it
real this right here everything you're looking for is right
here in your hand when it comes to enlightenment non-duality
spirituality all the wacky stuff I talk about it's all
right here in your hand right now actual this is
actual the problem is that way too many of you
are getting lost in all sorts of ideas about non
duality so let's keep deepening and sharpening this distinction between
actuality and concept I want you to think about the
fact that you are on around earth as you believe
you are think about that fact and now notice that
what that is is concept of imagination that is what
that is there's no disputing what is being said here
your mind might want to come up with objections and
you might say oh but Balea what are you saying
are you saying that I should be a flat earther
now are you saying now I shouldn't believe the earth
is flat are you saying size is wrong is that
what you're saying notice what that is that's concept and
imagination you're layering concept and imagination on top of concept
and imagination and so you're digging your own grave here
with your own mind you're getting lost inside your mind
so be very mindful of your objections actuality is what's
happening right now in this present moment your hand or
that object that table you're looking at that lamp you're
looking at that cat if you have a cat there
that's actual anything else does concept and imagination because it's
not here right now I'm not saying that you should
be a flat earther but the fact that the earth
is round is a concept and is imagination you have
to become conscious of that if you cannot become conscious
of that then god help you because you're [ __
] screwed in this work you're not gonna make any
progress you get this let's keep going now bring to
mind the fact that you were born you think you
were born notice the key word there though you think
you were born so notice what that is all of
your ideas and memories of being born our concept and
imagination getting this it's very simple but it's also quite
radical where did you come from well I was born
no that's concept and imagination think of your parents unless
they are sitting here in the room with you right
now your parents are concept and imagination no you might
say believe I talked to them last night that's concept
and imagination but Leo if I didn't come from my
parents where did I come from that's concept and imagination
be hyper aware of how your mind pulls you into
these various rabbit holes of questions and objections and denials
and all of this sort of stuff ignoring the obvious
of what's actual pull your hand out this is act
look at your hand this is actual now think of
your parents think of being born think of the round
earth that's all imagination are you getting this actually do
this now pull your hand out again and look at
it okay this is actual my parents are just a
concept oh okay now I'm getting it actually do this
don't think you've got it because you still don't got
it now moving on think of being enlightened you've heard
me talking about enlightenment ad nauseam over the years whatever
you imagine enlightenment to be think about that notice that
that's concept and imagination that's what that is those concepts
and those images are preventing you from becoming enlightened you
want to get as close to enlightenment as possible take
out your hand put it in front of your face
and look at it and realize that this is actual
and while you're looking at this hand and you're you're
sensing it's reality it's realness is actuality that is enlightenment
you're looking at enlightenment right here in your hand I'm
not kidding all of your ideas and theories and philosophies
about enlightenment that's not enlightenment that's [ __ ] this
is enlightenment right here so if you want to become
enlightened just sit and look at your hand for many
many many hours for hundreds and thousands of hours just
sit there and looking at it that's it and you'll
become enlightened now you'll say but Leo how is how
is looking at my hand gonna make me enlightened I
mean the hand is just a hand again that's because
you haven't actually gone deep into this work you haven't
even spent five minutes just looking at your hand without
thinking about it something very profound happens we just do
this exercise for hundreds and thousands of hours what you
see here will change and now of course by that
don't get the wrong idea I don't mean that you're
gonna be looking at this hand and then all the
sudden it's gonna turn into a tentacle that's not what
I mean I mean that you'll still basically see the
same shape the same colors here but again your your
context will change this hand will get recontextualized into something
else than a human hand and what that thing is
can't be explained to you because it has no name
and it has no verbal description but when you get
it you'll get it and until then you'll be lost
and you'll be confused and you'll not understand what I'm
talking about right but the more you sit here the
more you look at it and the more you start
to feel that wait a minute this hand this is
a weird thing why does it why is it here
what is this hand why does it exist I mean
sure it's a hand but that doesn't say anything about
it what is it what's it made out of really
like what is this thing and why is it here
how come it exists and the more you get a
conscious of that the more you become conscious of that
right now the closer you're getting to enlightenment that feeling
of realness is what you're going with when you're doing
any kind of consciousness work or spiritual practice that's it
it's extremely simple it's so simple that nobody wants to
do it it's so simple that it seems like it
won't lead anywhere it's so simple it seems like it's
a waste of time so nobody does it and so
nobody discovers what's right there in front of their face
think about evolution whatever your ideas and opinions about evolution
are whether you believe in it or not think about
that and again notice that that's all concept and imagination
now take out your hand look at your hand again
that's actuality evolution that's imagination now think about science and
reason and logic think about proof and evidence all of
that is concept and imagination take out your hand again
put it in front of your face and notice that
this is actual right here you cannot get more direct
than this right here to reality science reason logic proofs
and evidence all of that that is further removed from
reality than this hand right here are you getting this
there is no proof or evidence or logic for this
hand being here this hand is prior to all of
that you're getting this there is no proof for this
hand other than you looking at this hand and really
even that is saying too much there's not a you
looking at this hand and this thing is not really
a hand if you look at it long enough and
there's actually no looking happening either so be careful about
that you think that I'm here this is a hand
this is a human body a biological organism that was
born and that I am looking at this hand that
is all imagination and concept none of that is actually
true none of that is actual what is actual here
is this but what is this that's what you got
to sit with that's what you got to sit with
don't let your mind come in there and start thinking
a bunch of thoughts that's taking you into Imaginationland all
right now think of the universe the entire universe all
the galaxies and stars in the Milky Way and all
the planets that are out there and aliens and [
__ ] that live out there and black holes and
the Big Bang and all of that think of all
that and notice what that is that's concept and imagination
pull out your hand again ground yourself in actuality this
is actual all that other stuff that's imagination see notice
that even if you're just sitting here if you're sitting
on your couch mining your own business watching some YouTube
videos in the back of your mind you still have
this sort of orienting frame this is the context in
which you are putting yourself you are putting yourself into
this context this orienting frame of I'm sitting on a
round planet which is orbiting a Sun which is part
of a Milky Way which is part of a Big
Bang part of the entire universe somewhere in the back
of your mind that context is there that's contextualizing this
experience that you're having right now so realize that all
of that is concept and imagination that's not actual what's
actual is this raw experience right now what is this
raw experience right now of this room that you're in
when you strip it of all context including the context
that this is occurring within a universe in some Milky
Way galaxy in some solar system on some giant rock
orbiting the Sun when you remove all that context what
do you got left when you remove the context that
you were born what do you got left when you
remove the context that you're a human being what do
you have left the problem with this is it's it's
a lot harder to actually do this than it sounds
you're not going to be able to just sit there
for five minutes and strip your mind of all of
its context and this is the only thing that's preventing
you from enlightenment is that this this very stubborn context
is there and it feels so real that you're not
classifying this context as concept or imagination to you it
feels like reality so really if you're going to be
doing this process correctly what's going to be happening is
that as you're as you're distinguishing between actuality and concept
eventually you're gonna discover that more and more the stuff
that you thought was real is actually just conceptual context
and you're gonna strip that away and strip it away
and strip it away to the point where you're gonna
start to lose your mind because reality's gonna start to
collapse underneath you you're not gonna know what's real or
unreal anymore other than what's actual all right you've never
start to question things like whether you were born or
whether you have parents or whether there exists a milky
way or whether a BIGBANG ever happened because you're gonna
realize none of that stuff is actual and one once
you once you start to realize this it's gonna actually
be quite frightening and a little bit disturbing because you're
gonna feel like you're going insane and that's exactly correct
so the mistake that people make is they think that
oh no I'm doing something wrong no you're doing exactly
right everything is exactly right what you're realizing is just
that how imaginary most of what you call reality is
and that can be a little disturbing so don't don't
don't worry about that keep going keep going deeper so
now think of consciousness as it's arising in the neurons
in your brain right that's what science tells us this
what science says consciousness is so think about that as
you're sitting here you're looking out this room you are
telling yourself that all all of this is some sort
of activity of my brain the various neurons and chemicals
in there they're doing all of this but notice that
that's concept and imagination compare it with your hand pull
out your hand look at what's actual now think again
about your ideas about the brain all imagination now here's
a really tricky one think about your body can you
notice that your body is concept and imagination you would
say well but Lea what do you mean body is
actual look the hand you were showing me the hand
and that's actual that's not imagination but this is not
the body this is not what you think the body
is when I say the word body you have a
very specific concept and image that comes to mind for
you of your body this is a conceptual imaginary construction
now if you actually want to contrast that with what's
real what's actual then close your eyes and actually feel
what we would traditionally call the body just feel it
but notice that whatever you're feeling you're not feeling the
body there's a it's like a cloud of various kinds
of sensations from your feet to your abdomen to your
back to your chest your phase to your hands there's
various kinds of amorphous sensations certain parts of it you
can't even really feel at all and so what you've
got these you've got a cloud of various kinds of
sensations now those sensations those are actual but that's not
the body the body is a very specific imaginary construct
that you have now you might look down and say
well Leo I'm looking down here and look I'm seeing
my body so there it is how can you say
the body's conceptual when I'm looking at it but what
you're looking at is not the body what you're looking
at is some stuff and what exactly it is you
don't quite know unless you project a lot of concepts
onto it you don't really know what it is you're
looking at you don't even know that it's you you
think this body is yours you think you're in control
this body you think you were born in this body
you think this body is responsible for everything that you're
seeing out there you think that this body is perceiving
that table and that lamp and that cat and that
dog and that tree and that wall all of that
notice that that's concept and imagination now think of all
the teachings that you've gotten from me from actualized org
everything I've ever shared with you every insight every idea
every everything you've ever learned for me notice that that
is concept and belief that is all you ever get
for me is concept and belief not just for me
but any teacher on any subject now compare that to
your hand this is actual and everything I've ever told
you that's all concepts and belief you see the biggest
trap with all of these teachings that I teach is
that we have to communicate through concepts and through beliefs
there's no other way that's inherent to communication so we're
always dealing with this inherent limitation to communication and you
have to be able to understand these various pointers these
conceptual pointers that are being given to you and then
go beyond them to actuality you see so when I
tell you something about your hand what you need to
be able to do is you got to say oh
he's talking about my actual hand let me look at
my hand oh yeah that's my hand oh yeah actuality
here it is that's what he's talking about when he
says the word hand right but most people who listen
to my videos never ever do that never and that's
why they misunderstand 90% of the things that I say
now think of God whatever your ideas and thoughts about
God are whether you believe in God or don't believe
in God whether you like God or hate God whatever
your religion told you about God bring all that to
mind notice that that's a concept and that's imagination get
that now pull out your hand look at your hand
again this is actual right here all your ideas about
God that's all imagination in fact if you want to
understand what God is look at your hand this right
here is God I'm not joking this is God look
at it become conscious of it sit here for four
five hours looking at this hand until you realize that
this hand is God I'm not kidding this is it
all your ideas about God that's nonsense that's not God
this is God right here God is actuality so why
is spirituality and actuality the same thing because spirituality is
about connecting with God and what is God God is
what's actual and what's actual is all of this whatever
it is that's God it's that simple you're overlooking the
obvious now of course you're gonna say Leo but but
well this is absurd I mean my hand is not
God your it sounds like you're playing word games here
and you're trying to make something that's not God into
God I mean what what what kind of joke is
this you can't be serious again because you're under estimating
the power of the context in which you're interpreting all
this so when you're looking at this hand you can't
see the God of it because you think it's my
hand your idea that it's my hand is blocking you
from seeing that actually no this is God I mean
it's just that simple but it's gonna take you a
lot of time looking at this thing to realize what's
being said here this is not an easy thing to
get requires a lot of consciousness a lot of consciousness
you have to be really conscious on what this hand
is and of course not just this hand you can
you can look at a cat or a dog or
a tree or a lamp or a wall and realize
that it's God God is this entire field right here
this whole field that's conscious that's self-aware this self-aware field
is God now think of your death and non-existence right
you believe you're gonna die you're worried about dying what
is that what is death notice that's a concept and
that's imagination this entire time that you've been alive you've
been worried about death in all sorts of ways whether
it was near-miss car accidents or being on an airplane
and getting some turbulence that frightened you or maybe you
would to get an STD test and you were afraid
for a few days of what the results might be
what is all this is all you fearing your death
right so what is all that that was all concept
in all imagination it was an actual tada non-existence is
an idea that exists pull out your hand again and
notice that this thing this is actual this is existence
right here now think of non-existence that right there that's
imagination there's no such thing as non-existence there is only
existence there is only life there is no death but
again notice all of the objections that your mind comes
up with Alba leo but what are you talking about
that can't be true that doesn't make any sense but
what happens if you shoot yourself what happens if you
drink some poison what happens if you jump off a
cliff what about all that all of that is your
imagination which you are lost inside of I mean there's
not much to say about this stuff because it's so
obvious you either get it or you don't there's no
arguing with me here it's not like you're gonna bring
up some scientific proof or some evidence or some whatever
to demonstrate something with don't argue with me there's no
arguing here look at your hand this is it the
sexuality everything else is imagination all your arguments are imagination
and how do you know that's true not by believing
me but by looking at it I'm not asking you
to buy into some philosophy of mine here I'm just
pointing to you what is the the case that you're
overlooking right so don't agree with me that death is
a concept rather look in your actual experience and notice
compare the hand here this is actuality with death what
is death right now if I'm thinking about death what
is that oh yeah that's imagination okay yeah he's right
he's right it's true of course it's true that's how
this process works now think about truth everybody loves to
be a Crusader of truth a champion of truth everyone
thinks they have the truth what is the truth whatever
you think the truth is bring it up to mind
right now bring to mind the most true things that
you know and notice that that is concept and imagination
that is not the truth you want the truth pull
out your hand this right here look at it be
conscious of it yeah that's the truth this is the
truth right here the truth is not some lofty metaphysical
philosophical arcane esoteric thing it's your hand this is the
truth this room you're sitting in this is the truth
that's it everything else is not the truth that's it
think of your political preferences whether you're conservative or a
liberal Republican Democrat whatever think of your highest political ideals
whether it's equality or freedom of speech or civil rights
or justice and fairness and law and order whatever it
is bring it up what is that that's concept and
imagination all of it yeah but Leo I think that
the Constitution is really good and I think freedom of
speech is the most important and I think liberty is
the highest ideal that's all imagination yeah leo but do
you want to live in a society that's not free
and that's going to be filled with totalitarian Nazis and
communists and all this that's imagination no Leo but it's
real the the constant Nazi concentration camps were real the
Communists gulags were all real that's imagination yeah leo but
what should we do how should we run our government
in structure society that's imagination watch out for how your
mind sucks you in your mind will extort you you
realize that your own mind is extorting you with fear
fear of everything that's gonna go wrong if you don't
buy into its imaginary schemes that's what's going on here
every single objection you have to what I'm saying is
just fear it's a knee-jerk fear reaction notice that you're
afraid of what happens if we question signs you're afraid
of what happens if we question your god we you're
afraid of what happens with question morality if we question
religion if we question the Constitution if we question politics
if we question reality you're afraid of what's gonna happen
psyche oh no leo but what's gonna happen am I
gonna lose my life is something bad gonna go wrong
is Society gonna go to hell but a whole fear
is imagination pull out your and look at it is
there any fear here when you're looking at the actual
hand is there fear here there's no fear there's just
the hand that's actual fear is imaginary bhalil if I
don't fear then I can get myself killed remember that
death is imaginary too so the worst thing you think
will happen if you get rid of fear which is
your death is itself imaginary imagine that again don't believe
me sit down and actually look is what I'm saying
true remember what truth is truth is right here this
is truth this is truth right here so is what
I'm saying truth take a look think of all of
human history everything that you learned in school from the
crucifixion of Christ to Julius Caesar and the Mongol hordes
the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution
and Galileo and Isaac Newton and World War one and
World War two and the assassination of JFK and all
of this think about human history notice what that is
that's concept and imagination compare it with your hand this
here is actuality Hitler in World War two that's imagination
think of atoms and molecules maybe you're looking at this
hand and you're wondering yeah what is it made out
of I guess it must be matter of cells and
those are made of organelles and those are made of
molecules and those are made of atoms and those are
made of quarks and things and strings and quantum particles
and things but what is all that that's concept and
imagination compare that to what's actually here none of that
none of these molecules or atoms or anything is actually
here what's actually here is what's actually here not anything
else nothing you think is actually here is here only
what's actually here is here and lastly take a small
object find any small object lying around you like a
pen like this it could be anything a pen a
piece of paper a book a tennis ball a paperclip
something small you can hold like this and now look
at it look at this object as though you're looking
at it for the very first time in your life
and as you're looking at it sort of make love
to it with your eyes but also with your fingers
like feel every part of this object trace every line
and every curve on this object with your fingertips slowly
and also with your eyes and just marvel at its
existence and its actuality and become conscious right here right
now that this thing is actually this is actual and
just feel it and look at it and just really
take your time and go very slowly with it and
just wonder what is the substance of this thing what
is this thing made out of and be very careful
that your mind doesn't come up with all sorts of
conceptual answers like metal or plastic or glass or rubber
but just look at it notice for example if you're
feeling rubber like right now I'm feeling some rubber here
on this grip of this pen that feeling of rubber
what is that the feeling of rubber is not rubber
so what is the feeling of rubber what is the
feeling of plastic the feeling of plastic is not plastic
and just keep doing that and contrast that with any
thoughts or ideas you have about that experience this right
here is actuality this is how spirituality is done with
these types of exercises that we did here together so
I want you to keep grounding yourself in your direct
experience so what we've been exploring here is direct experience
that's another word for it actuality direct experience truth being
consciousness these are all identical the all point to the
same thing and keep making the distinction in your mind
between concepts and imagination and actuality keep sharpening this distinction
keep practicing it over and over and over again this
is gonna take a lot of work this is gonna
take hundreds and thousands of hours of your life to
do this work but it's going to be highly worthwhile
and you're not going to know the full benefits of
doing this work until you actually do this work because
the benefits of it are actual and not conceptual if
I told you all the benefits I could but if
I told you all the benefits all that would be
would be just more concepts and so what you would
have you have a lot of concepts about the benefits
but you wouldn't have the actual benefits so instead what
I want you to have is the actual benefits rather
than the concepts and ideas of benefits so if you've
been watching actualize I work for a long time and
what you have is a lot of ideas but you're
struggling to get the actual benefits you only have the
theoretical benefits that's because you're not doing the actual work
and so therefore what you have is you have only
ideas of the benefits which is better than nothing it's
better than where you were when you started when you
know about any of it about any of this stuff
where you were just depressed and miserable and lost it's
better than that but you got to go one step
further which is to get the actual benefits I want
you to be very honest with yourself about the benefits
you get from this work or really any teaching for
that matter any teaching you got to be brutally honest
with yourself and ask yourself this yes I've been learning
all this stuff but what actual actual benefits have I
gotten not theoretical benefits because you have a bunch of
benefits you think you've gotten from your imagination what are
the actual benefits that I've gotten from my meditation from
my yoga from my psychedelics from my reading of books
from my listening to those videos from my listening to
these videos from my attending this class over here from
my listening to that person over there what's the actual
benefit and what you'll discover is that the actual benefits
are a lot lot lower than your imaginary benefits and
that's going to be a little bit disturbing at first
it's not comfortable to realize that but also that's a
very important to realization because then you start to realize
like oh yeah so I've been getting hooked on these
imaginary benefits but where are the actual benefits how do
I get me some of those and then you realize
go yeah I got to actually be doing more practices
then you'll start to do more practices and you'll actually
start to see more actual benefits every insight or lesson
that I share with you through these videos you must
locate them in your direct experience it's not enough just
to hear them and to understand them you must locate
them you must match up the words I use with
actuality let's go through a few examples of what I
mean because this is this is gonna determine the difference
of whether you're gonna get huge results or miniscule results
with these teachings so for example I might tell you
as an insight or a lesson that direct experience is
all that exists that's the insight direct experience is all
that exists do you agree with me do you disagree
with me it doesn't matter because that's just a concept
when I say direct experience is all that exists that
is pointing to something so what you need to do
is you need to go to the next step and
not just agree or disagree with me but you need
to actually sit down and look at actuality actuality is
what's happening right here and then look at it and
say to yourself well is what he's saying true how
do I know what he's saying is true is it
true that direct experience is all that exists let me
look that's an experience that's an experience that's an experience
that's an experience that's an experience the thoughts in my
mind aren't experienced oh yeah everything is experienced so direct
experience is all that exists that's what he was saying
that's true okay now I got it I got it
or take this other example I've said in the past
that evil is a concept do you agree with me
or disagree with me it doesn't matter whether you do
or don't because when I say that evil is a
concept I mean that you need to pause look at
actuality look at your hand look at it and ask
yourself is this evil No okay so there's no evil
here is this one evil no is that dog evil
no is that cat evil no is that person on
TV evil no and you go through this until you
realize that evil what is evil oh yeah it's a
concept and then you got it the mistake is to
try to argue with me like oh no leo but
what about Hitler Hitler was truly evil how dare you
buh-buh-buh-buh-buh buhbuh all of that is imagination that is not
doing the work doing the work is to actually open
up a history book of Hitler find Hitler's photograph in
the history book look at that photograph with your consciousness
look at what's actually there the actual photograph and ask
yourself is that is that actually evil and what you'll
realize that it's not nor was Hitler in the flesh
if you want to imagine Hitler in the flesh if
you looked at him in the flesh you would also
realize that he's not evil don't believe me actually do
it and see of course you can't do with Hitler
because Hitler's just in your imagination after all but you
can do it like with the some other person that
you really hate who's still alive and who's real and
who may be good to look at from a distance
if you think he's evil then you probably don't want
to come too close to him but you could look
at him from a distance maybe through a binocular and
then ask yourself is that thing that I'm saying through
the binocular is that evil and you'll realize that it's
not mm-hmm another example I've said in the past that
everything is consciousness do you agree with me disagree with
me doesn't matter look look what is here look at
this hand until you realize that this hand is consciousness
this is consciousness this is consciousness that's consciousness that's consciousness
oh yeah it's all consciousness let me try to think
of something that isn't consciousness oh I thought of it
but thoughts are consciousness okay so everything is consciousness oh
yeah that's correct I've said in the past that meaning
is a concept meaning is something you project onto actuality
so you look at this hand and you ask yourself
does this hand have meaning no you look at that
table and you ask oh does that table have meaning
no does that dog have meaning no does anything have
meaning does this room have meaning does this experience have
meaning oh yeah it doesn't does it anything that I
think has meaning let me look at it oh yeah
what is meaning oh yeah it's my imagination there's the
actual thing there's my imagination which is projecting the meaning
onto the thing okay yeah that's correct meaning is a
concept how about when I say the self is a
concept the self or ego you I've said many times
before that you are a concept but what does that
actually mean this one's very very tricky what you need
to do is stop thinking about it and actually look
at what's happening right here the actuality of your hand
start there and ask yourself is this hand me know
is this arm me know is this face me know
what is me what is the self what is the
ego and you keep looking and looking and looking until
you realize that oh yeah the self is an imagination
do you imagine yourself that's what that is that's what
I am I've said in the past that you are
God this gets a lot of people riled up Leo
how dare you you're so arrogant and egotistical and all
this blah blah blah blah blah and you contradict my
religion and you you don't understand non-duality and you you're
you butan enlightened how dare you say such things all
of that is imagination or you could look at your
actual hand and realize that this hand is God and
not just this hand but this arm this torso this
head and everything around here now that one's gonna be
difficult it's not easy to realize that everything is good
that requires a radical radical radical elevation in your consciousness
to realize that a radical D contextualization of this experience
that you're having now because he the problem is that
you think that you exist as an ego and so
because you think you exist as an ego or as
a self you think you were born therefore you think
that you are this biological being because you need to
explain what you are so you explain to yourself conceptually
that your biological creature and you explain to yourself that
biological creatures can experience all of this stuff this experience
this experience is my experience of biological creature and that's
what I am that's what you tell yourself and so
what you don't realize though yet is that actually what
you've done is used usurped God so what this is
this is God but because you have all these concepts
explaining where you came from and you need to explain
to yourself why you exist because you believe you exist
and you don't want to admit that you're a belief
or an imagination or a concept what you need to
tell yourself is you need to you need to say
that all of this is mine if it's part of
me and it's coming from me from my brain it's
being rendered by my brain and the neurons and all
this and so I'll connect it to me to my
body and this was all me and I feel me
and it's all me me me me me me me
me me so you're just walking out saying me me
me me me all the time so you're saying me
me me so much that there's no room left for
God what you've done is you've taken God and you've
recontextualized God into yourself and you split yourself off such
that this is God but you can't see God because
you've put yourself in the place of God this is
literally what the devil does so by definition you are
the devil the devil is one who takes the place
of God like the cuckoo bird I told you about
in self-deception mechanisms episode I told you about the cuckoo
bird who finds a nest of other birds full of
eggs that cuckoo bird gets in there she lays her
egg amongst all the other eggs and then that who
cuckoo egg it hatches first before all the other eggs
and then it proceeds to kick all the other eggs
out of the nest and pretends to be the only
surviving baby of those other birds and then those birds
they just buy into it and they believe that that
bird is is their baby and the mother cuckoo flies
off and does other things right so this is exactly
what you have done with God tada [Music] that's it
God is not some supernatural mysterious thing out there somewhere
in the clouds no no this is God this right
this is all of this everything you've ever experienced is
gut actualities God but you can't see it because you've
mistaken God for you now of course you're gonna say
Leo but I don't think I'm God that's right because
you've so mistaken God for you that all there is
is you see you've you've taken the place of God
so totally that you've basically killed God and you've only
left yourself and now you walk around asking Oh where's
God God such a stupid idea God God is a
stud the dumbest idea you can't possibly believe you walk
around saying all this while you are God convinced that
you're not God it's the [ __ ] dumbest thing
you could possibly do I mean it's just like it's
it's absurd what you're doing it's absurd it's absurd it's
it's disgusting I mean it's disgusting you're a devil and
you do this because you're so full of yourself that's
it it's just pure ego pure devilry that's all you're
doing that's all you're doing here but of course one
final twist to this tale is that God and the
devil are actually identical so God is the devil God
creates through illusion and through devilry I'll leave that for
you to discover remember don't argue with me what I'm
saying is it true is it true what I'm saying
look for yourself here's another insight I've shared in the
past which is that happiness what is happiness happiness is
acceptance of the present moment regardless of whatever it is
that is precisely the definition of happiness is that true
do you need to go into google and type it
in to see if it's true do you need to
go ask your psychology professor if what I'm saying is
true no what you do is you locate happiness right
now in the present moment look at this hand right
now ground yourself in actuality okay that's actuality now feel
your emotions that's also actuality whatever feelings you have in
your body are you happy right now maybe yes maybe
no now make yourself feel happy right now make yourself
feel happy and how do you do that by looking
at the definition what is the definition of happiness acceptance
of the present moment whatever it is so fully accept
this present moment and as you do that notice yourself
becoming happy happiness is enjoyment of the President so start
to enjoy the present moment whatever it is it doesn't
matter I don't care if you've a a pain in
your back or if there's something in your life it
only doesn't matter whatever is is what you need to
be happy about so be happy about whatever you have
if you have a toothache be happy about your toothache
and notice yourself being happy and then you say oh
yeah it's true and maybe throughout the week when you
become sad or frustrated or angry you could try it
again and you can ask yourself wait a minute why
am I not happy right now oh yeah it's because
I'm resisting the present moment I don't want the present
moment I want something else I want a future moment
I want my imaginary moment and I'm denying what's right
here right now that's why I'm unhappy okay got it
it's true what Leo said is true and the last
example is that death is a concept so again don't
argue with me about what death is look in your
direct experience at what death is what is death you're
imagining it notice that there cannot be death unless you're
imagining it so by definition death is an imagination this
isn't rocket science super obvious stuff but you got to
actually do it don't just believe me on it some
of these things that you will discover as you do
this investigation will be very radical and shocking and they
will seem like it's like no can this possibly be
true no you know it can't possibly be true that's
right because you have so many false beliefs and notions
that you've picked up from your society from your religion
from science from culture from everywhere that now when you
actually see the truth the truth is so radical compared
to what you've been taught or what you've imagined that
most people when they see the truth they dismiss the
truth and instead go back to their imaginations because they
say now the truth can't be like this can't possibly
be like this that's not what I've been taught that's
not what I've been told that's not what I've thought
about before my whole life that's right the truth is
something new the truth is something different and you have
to be open to that be open to new radical
truths let the truth shock you let the truth be
whatever it is don't second guess guess actuality you see
whatever's actual go with that rather than your ideas about
what should be true what would be good to be
true what religion told me should be true what science
you know this is what's true this and it doesn't
care about who told you what or what you want
to be true this is true keep grounding and re
grounding yourself over and over and over again especially in
your hands this is one of my favorite exercises these
days is just looking at my hands grounding myself in
the actuality of my hands this helps me to break
out of my mind and I want you to notice
over the next week and over the next month how
your minds are gonna be pulling you back into Imaginationland
so you're gonna have to be doing this exercise over
and over again it's kind of like with lucid dreaming
you know and lucid dreaming they tell you when you're
inside your dream look at your hands and that will
be a trigger to get you to realize that this
is a dream well we're sort of doing that but
a little bit of the opposite we're actually looking our
hands to realize that our hands are what's actual and
that everything else is concepts as a homework assignment I
highly recommend that you contemplate using your journal the following
four questions what is a concept what is a belief
what is imagination and what is actuality when you contemplate
here like I talked about in my contemplation episode and
how to contemplate using a journal episode when you contemplate
you're not just thinking but you're actually looking at what's
actual so to answer the question what is a concept
you need to actually actually feel the concept inside actually
find a belief and look at the belief exam and
the belief observe the belief to see what a belief
is and so on also a few more homework assignments
for you I want you to spend 15 minutes every
day closely looking at your hand or hands you can
use both in silence set a timer for 15 minutes
and then just sit there and look at it for
15 minutes straight without thinking about it try to strip
all contexts and all imagination away from and just look
at it like that and that's going to be your
little exercise and another one that i highly recommand is
that you you do the same thing but with an
object so take a small object like this pen or
a book or a pencil or something post-it note and
just sit there and look at it the way that
I showed you for fifteen minutes straight with a timer
and as you're doing both of these exercises I want
you to understand that these are the most pure spiritual
exercises that you will ever do there is no more
pure form spirituality forget about prayer forget about yoga forget
about all that horseshit this this is where it's at
right here if you can't be conscious that this pen
is God then none of your spirituality matters none of
it matters if you can't be conscious that this pen
is you none of your spirituality matters if you can't
clearly distinguish between a concept and the actual thing then
none of your spirituality matters and also as you're doing
both of these exercises with your hands and the pen
I want you to be reminding yourself your mind is
still going to be active you're not gonna be able
to completely turn off your mind for 15 minutes unless
you're super experienced at meditation so for most of you
your mind is still gonna be churning so as long
as it's churning you can use it to help you
a little bit and the way you can use it
is you can use it to remind you that this
right here this this hand this is consciousness and this
pen right here this is consciousness and so in fact
you could take the pen and put it in your
hand like this so you got both of them and
as you're sitting there keep reminding so you're looking at
it you're feeling the actuality of this thing here and
then I want you to just subtly use your mind
to remind you that this is all consciousness now at
first when you do that it might feel untrue and
it might feel like you don't know what that even
means leo how can a pen be consciousness but just
keep at it you're not so much programming your mind
or brainwashing your mind you this is not an affirmation
it's just your subtly pointing your mind in the direction
of what's true which is that all all of everything
is consciousness it doesn't matter what object you take you
could take a tennis ball a cat a dog a
human a tree a spaceship it's all gonna be consciousness
right so it doesn't matter which objects you use and
just keep doing that keep doing that and you'll start
to notice some benefits from this you'll start to notice
how you're actually drawing yourself out of your mind and
into the real world and now you start to see
what real spirituality is about and then if you keep
doing this long enough eventually you'll you'll have some deep
insights will have some epiphanies you might even have some
enlightenment experiences some mystical experiences and then you'll understand why
it's called spirituality but for now you probably won't so
this does require a little bit of faith faith in
the process not faith in me not faith in God
but just faith in the process this is like a
science experiment you need to have enough faith in a
science experiment to run the experiment could you imagine being
a scientist who is so cynical and so skeptical that
he can't even go and pick up a a test-tube
and put it in the oven to run his experiment
in his lab because he's so skeptical and so cynical
you can't have science this way science only works when
you have enough faith to be able to execute the
experiment and many science experiments you know what they can
take months and years to complete they could cost millions
and billions of dollars Large Hadron Collider particle accelerators those
take five to ten years to build and I don't
know how many billions of dollars to to to fund
those right so the scientists have to have enough faith
that they will go through all this and you know
what maybe they'll never discover any kind of big particle
or any kind of new physical phenomena they might build
this particle collider and it might fail that's what science
is about that's what experimentation is about there's always a
risk you're always exploring into the unknown because if you
already knew it you wouldn't need to go explore it
all right that's it enough of this I'm done here
please click that like button for me and come check
out actualized Edward right here that's my website you will
find some good resources there you'll find my book list
you'll find a life purpose course you'll find the actualized
forum and my blog lately I've been putting a lot
of new content on my blog various kinds of documentaries
and videos very profound stuff there so make sure you
go check that out and the stuff that I post
on my blog is only found on my blog I
also post videos on my blog exclusive videos that you
don't find on my youtube channel or anywhere else only
on the blog and I'll be posting a lot more
of those in the weeks and months to come so
stick around I'll probably be posting a couple of those
per week I've got a lot that I've shot lately
I've got like 10 videos that I'm gonna be posting
on my blog that I shot which are sort of
in the queue and I'm just waiting for them for
the right time to publish them so go check those
out and the last thing I'll tell you here as
we wrap up is just that you need to appreciate
the the fact that these teachings that I'm trying to
offer you are very advanced and I don't say that
to brag it's just the case you're learning about things
here that 99.99999% of people on earth don't know and
won't know for another hundred or for another thousand years
that's the case and this includes scientists and academics and
psychologists and intellectuals and philosophers and all of them they
don't know this stuff either for the most part a
very small percentage of them do so we're talking about
very advanced stuff here and the reason it's advanced is
because it requires your participation it requires extreme nuance it
requires dedication experimentation personal investigation putting skin in the game
sitting for hundreds of hours looking at your hand when
you don't want to because you're so bored that's the
cost of understanding these things did you really think that
you were going to get to the bottom of reality
did you really think that you were going to understand
the universe and existence and God and life and death
and love and evil and good and and mankind and
and how your mind works you think you're gonna understand
all of this just by sitting and watching these videos
while you're playing video games or some [ __ ]
like that in the background you think that that was
gonna work it's precisely because nobody wants to pay the
cost of doing these personal experiments that hardly anyone understands
these teachings and that's why they are advanced because mostly
what we do is we just accept whatever our culture
teaches us unquestioningly this is not just true of a
religion this is true of every single piece of knowledge
that you have all of science all of logic all
of rationality all of mathematics all of politics of course
religion philosophy and anything else all of it you didn't
through personal investigation of actuality you got it through secondhand
hearsay you got it as beliefs and imaginations from other
people because that's what's is easy and what's difficult about
this work is that it's very different from the way
that you were taught to learn at school as school
you were taught just to memorize stuff and to believe
stuff even when they were teaching new science they were
teaching about molecules and atoms and chemistry and biology all
of that was just brute force memorization of concepts and
beliefs it's no different than the indoctrination that happens for
example in Islamic schools in Afghanistan and in Syria and
in Iraq the kind of indoctrination that happens in those
schools is exactly exactly the kind of indoctrination that happens
in American schools European schools in developed countries exactly the
same the only difference is the content and the problem
with this is that nobody actually learns how to investigate
actuality and so everyone is operating on beliefs and imagination
concepts and then when they listen to what I'm saying
they interpret that as just more of the same and
then they start to dispute me and and contest what
I'm saying try to come up with clever arguments against
things that I've said this is a complete waste of
time a complete waste of time it doesn't matter whether
you believe what I say or don't believe what I
say what matters is what what you are willing to
investigate for yourself and what I'm offering here is just
ideas and hints for which parts of life are worth
investigating for you and you don't need to trust me
on that verify for yourself verify for yourself whether it's
worth investigating what consciousness is what the mind is what
concepts are what's happiness is what sadness is what fear
is I'm telling you that these are the most worthwhile
things that you can investigate in your life but you
don't know that the only way you'll know that is
by actually going out there and trying in comparing it
with other stuff whatever other things you want to do
pursue sex or pursue marriage or pursue career and money
or whatever do all that stuff compare and see if
what I'm saying is true and then you'll know that
it is this is what makes actualize that work very
different from most other channels for most other teachings and
it's not religion it's not New Age beliefs it's not
even science it transcends all of that all of that
is inferior compared to what we're doing here this is
direct investigation of actuality and as we go forward in
the future I'm gonna be pushing you more and more
to investigate this stuff for yourself and I'm gonna be
offering you less and less answers and pushing you more
and more because me giving you all these answers just
spoils you and ends up backfiring for you and because
honestly you're not going to understand the things that are
you talking about in the future if you don't start
to seriously do this work it's already the case over
the last year the episodes that I released over last
year are so advanced that even those of you who
think you understand everything you have only understood 10% of
the things that I've said that's how advanced this stuff
is do not underestimate this work and stay tuned for
more you
