            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/Ie8olvmaZug' target='_blank'>Be Fucking Patient! - How To Deal With Lack Of Results</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Importance of patience</b>: Leo Gura discusses the pivotal role of patience in achieving significant accomplishments in life. He suggests that a lack of patience often hinders people from reaching their goals and getting the results they aspire to. According to Gura, this issue primarily stems from the mind's tendency to set unrealistic expectations and desire quick results. 
</li><li><b>The mind's shortcomings in distributing work over time</b>: The mind struggles with comprehending large numbers and long periods. Consequently, it fails to distribute work evenly across time and sets unrealistic expectations. Gura suggests that this difficulty leads people to overestimate what they can achieve in a short time and underestimate what they can achieve in a long time. 
</li><li><b>Exponential growth curve for results</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that results don't come linearly but follow an exponential growth curve. In the beginning phase of any project or endeavor, the results are gradual and may seem insignificant despite the substantial effort and emotional labor. However, with ongoing persistence, the results start to hit the knee of the curve, leading to an explosion in growth.
</li><li><b>Emotional understanding of patience</b>: Despite logically understanding the importance of patience, many people struggle to emotionally grasp this concept. Gura highlights that this emotional misunderstanding often leads to frustration and stress at the beginning of every new project or endeavor. He suggests that it is important for individuals to emotionally accept that the starting phase of a project is the most challenging and requires the most patience.
</li><li><b>Principle of patience and proportionate patience</b>:  Leo advises applying the principle of patience and proportionate patience on endeavor or projects, adjusting the level of patience based on the projects significance. He suggests that for big projects we should be willing to endure more setbacks and a longer timeline. If a project doesnt seem worth the wait, it's important to reassess and pick projects worth the investment.
</li><li><b>Persistence despite setbacks</b>: Leo cites that setbacks are common in the early stages of a project and can lead to a lot of disappointments. The key is to persist, reminding oneself that the beginning is the hardest part, but continued persistence will eventually lead to success. 
</li><li><b>Meditation and patience</b>:  Leo notes that beginners often expect immediate relaxation from meditation. However, meditation requires one to push through initial discomfort and reach a state of peace, which requires patience. 
</li><li><b>Strategic planning and patience</b>: Strategic thinking requires patience and setting time aside for strategic planning. Focusing on the overall context of your goals and long-term plans helps to maintain focus and prevent getting overwhelmed by details. 
</li><li><b>Need for active application of patience</b>: Waiting without taking action only leads to complacency and laziness. Leo advises active application of patience while continuing to take actions towards achieving your goals. He warns against the potential danger of waiting too long and complacency setting in.
</li><li><b>Identifying effective methods for progress</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of identifying effective methods. Ineffective methods will not yield noticeable results, whereas effective methods will show small signs of progress early on. By recognizing these small results, we can trust that more significant results will come in the long run.
</li><li><b>Questions to assess impatience</b>: Leo provides a set of questions to help assess one's impatience. These questions include identifying areas where one is trying to rush, questioning the urgency of the tasks, considering if the goal is still worth it if it takes longer, imagining how expectations would change with a focus on long-term results, and determining the appropriate pace for specific projects. 
</li><li><b>Practical content and its applications</b>: Leo urges adopting the content of his talk in practice, to help viewers understand their minds and guide them to success. He also mentions that regular reminders of this content through a newsletter can help individuals remember the importance of patience in their journey to achieve their goals.
</li><li><b>Applying the Principle of Patience as an Ointment</b>: Leo Gura discusses how applying the principle of patience can be likened to grooming a soothing ointment onto initial wounds or difficulties experienced at the start of a new project. This principle can be essential to continuously apply in the early stages of any endeavor.
</li><li><b>Proportionate Patience in Projects</b>: Gura affirms that the level of patience assigned to a project should be proportional to its significance in one's life. If a project is deemed challenging yet significant, such as writing a life-changing book, one should be prepared to endure setbacks and a longer timeline. 
</li><li><b>Identifying Worthwhile Projects</b>: Gura suggests that projects worth investing in should still be seen as worthy even if they take longer than expected. For instance, spending a decade to master meditation is a reliable investment due to its significant personal benefits. This rule of thumb can guide in choosing what endeavors one should be working on.
</li><li><b>Importance of Patience for Beginners</b>: Gura underscores that the principle of patience is crucial for beginners, especially those starting from a place of real deficiency like depression. Beginners should visualize patience like an ointment calming immediate needs and paving the way for future success, whether in the realms of relationships, finance, or meditation.
</li><li><b>Neediness Repels Success</b>: The irony is, newbies desperate for quick results often keep themselves in the newbie stage due to their impatient, needy behavior. This push for immediate outcomes often results in repelling potential successes in relationships or business ventures.
</li><li><b>Patience for Long-Term Growth</b>: Gura warns that seeking immediate relief in meditation or enlightenment work can lead to disappointment. Patience is required for steady, long-term growth and those new to meditation might experience an increase in mental restlessness before reaching the state of peace.
</li><li><b>Considering Pace and Urgency</b>: For big pursuits, Gura encourages the consideration of one's pace. How fast or slow one is trying to achieve something, the urgency of the goal, and the implications if the goal takes longer to achieve, are all significant factors in evaluating one's patience levels. This encourages a focus on the path or process rather than just the ultimate result.
</li><li><b>Principle of Patience</b>: Patience is crucial in important areas of life such as fitness, nutrition, relationships, emotional mastery, meditation, business finances, etc. For beginners who might feel desperate, continually reminding themselves to be patient may yield better results in time. Inefficacy during initial stages of new projects and tendencies to abandon them mid-way due to lack of results can be managed better through self-awareness and positive self-talk focused on long-term outcomes.
</li><li><b>Changing Self-Talk</b>: Effective self-talk aids in transforming the state of anxiety and disappointment to a state of readiness for long term results. Recognizing that early stages of a project or endeavor are the hardest and seeing the bigger picture of the long-term outcome can change negative self-talk to a positive one. By reaffirming that setbacks in the beginnings don't affect the ultimate goal can help to view efforts in the right perspective without self-doubt or sabotage.
</li><li><b>Strategic Thinking and Planning</b>: Befitting strategic thinking into one's lifestyle can significantly enhance the journey towards achieving long-term goals. Allocating specific times during the week to sit, plan, and strategize can help to connect daily work with larger objectives. Effective strategizing, similar to a successful military general before a battle, can lead to the prevention of unnecessary rush in projects and help to visualize the future consequences of any action.
</li><li><b>Slow Down the Work Pace</b>: Slowing down the work pace on projects can be beneficial in dealing with impatience for results. Unlike rushing towards the result by increasing the pace and seeking shortcuts, it is advisable to grow slowly and consistently over a longer period. The focus should be on the current path one is walking on rather than getting the result. 
</li><li><b>Take Consistent Actions</b>: Patience is implemented effectively when combined with consistent actions. Waiting for spontaneous results without taking necessary actions may lead to complacency and laziness. It is therefore important to ensure actions like trying different methods to work towards achieving goals, while patiently handling setbacks and hindrances. The focus is to avoid self-sabotage, stay on the path, and continue taking actions while maintaining a patient outlook.
</li><li><b>Applying the Principle of Patience</b>: Adopting patience in your actions, especially when the results are not immediate, is crucial. It can be seen in various scenarios - seeking water in the Sahara or finding solutions for emotional issues. However, do not blindly follow an ineffective method in the name of patience. Early indicators of method effectiveness can usually be seen and should be considered.  
</li><li><b>Ramifications of Patience</b>: The application of the principle of patience is vast - from personal growth areas such as confidence building and public speaking to professional growth areas such as business and career. Remember that the results, while taking longer than expected and requiring increased emotional effort, are often worth the investment.
</li><li><b>Strategic Planning and Pacing</b>: To effectively implement the principle of patience, consider your pace in pursuit of your goals. Ask yourself relevant questions about the speed you are operating at and what your expectations would look like if you focused on long-term results. Assess what a lazy, impatient, and wise pace would be for specific projects.
</li><li><b>Self-Actualization and Patience</b>: The journey of self-actualization necessitates immense patience. Regular reminders of being on this larger journey could help maintain perspective and ensure progress. Despite the difficulty, practice patience and learn from diverse experiences to navigate the road to self-actualization and achieve success. Being reminded of this journey and its potential transformative effect can be motivating and inspiring.
