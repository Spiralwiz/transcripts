hey this is Leo for actualised org and I'm coming
at you from Zion National Park in Utah check it
out whoa right nice huh this little river this little
stream I'm standing in has carved out its enormous Canyon
smaller than Grand Canyon but still pretty freakin large in
the middle of the Colorado Plateau anyhow the topic I
want to talk today about is information out versus information
in and this is simply the idea that if you
put garbage into your body you're gonna get garbage results
out and this applies both to what you put in
as in terms of food and drink but also then
what you put in in terms of the information what
are you feeding your brain that's the question that I
have for you and are you feeding your brain the
nourishing type of food that it needs to then generate
amazing results in your life and if you're not doing
this this is a simple fix that you can do
you can set up some habits put some things in
place to feed your brain better betterment source material for
me this has been a really powerful shift that I
made over the last four years is I've really made
a conscious effort to feed my brain really rich source
material so that then it can put out good results
and I just trust that if I feed myself good
stuff that's gonna lead to a lot of good things
in the long run it's kind of like you know
if you're feeding if you're feeding a little plant let's
say you you plant an oak an acorn in the
ground and you want it to grow into a big
tree well there's a lot of potential that acorn but
it's gonna be determined how actually how it actually grows
is gonna be determined by the soil that's in where
do you plant it how do you nourish it is
there enough nutrients in the soil are you watering it
enough right is there enough foundation there to ground the
roots so that it can grow into a big tree
well the same thing with your mind and another good
analogy is really with your body if you're feeding your
body foods they're not healthy for it here eating a
lot of junk food a lot of trans fats and
a lot of carbs a lot of sugars then what
you're gonna get you're gonna get bad result for your
body you're going you're gonna get a gut you're not
gonna have a lot of energy you're gonna feel bad
probably gonna lead to a lot of long-term problems down
the road diseases cancers etc you don't want that so
that's why you take care of your body and you
should also do the same with your mind now what
are some good and bad sources of food for your
mind well television generally especially just cable TV bad source
of food for your mind even stuff like the news
bad source of food for your mind because a lot
of that stuff is so negative and it also has
really nothing to do with you you don't have control
over a lot of that stuff and so that's a
common a common drain I see with a lot of
people it's common trait that I had I used to
be very very much in tune with the news always
watching the news every day watching all all the major
talk show hosts watching CNN Fox News MSNBC because I
wanted to keep my finger on the pulse of what
was going on I was interested in politics watching all
the elections all the pre election coverage doing all that
stuff but then I got fed up with it and
I just cut it out of my life and I've
been really happy as a result because what's happened is
that I freed up all that time all that mental
energy to focus on creating the kind of life that
I want to create for myself and I also replaced
it with much richer sources so if you think of
cable TV as like a bag of potato chips the
equivalent of eating about a bag of potato chips this
is not very healthy for you or like a Snickers
bar that's what cable TV is that's what watching a
sitcom is that's what watching a reality show is that's
what watching even something like CNN is that stuff is
not nourishing your brain what nourishes your brain stuff like
reading books talking to to people that have interesting information
to share with you having interesting discussions with friends contemplation
meditation spending time studying material if you're watching stuff watch
stuff that's actually educational so you can watch lectures there's
a lot of great lecture programs out there a lot
of documentaries nature shows that kind of stuff can be
enriching although generally TV is still a good idea to
moderate it right if you're if you're reading newspapers that
can also be a negative train because the thing with
news is that on the one hand you do keep
your finger on the pulse and that feels kind of
nice but the problem is you don't have control over
most of those things you know you read about some
horrible accident some forest fire some terrorist attack overseas something
that's happening in the war in another country you know
some some negotiation with some some dictator revolts overseas all
that kind of stuff you have no say over that
how that plays out mostly is irrelevant to you unless
you're you're involved with those affairs if you're like a
diplomat or whatever if you're involved with it that's I
think that's a different case and there are case can
be made for you having to keep your finger on
the pulse but if you're just a normal person a
layman so to speak that is off doing minding his
own business doing his own life and creating something for
yourself you should be focused on that rather than worrying
about all these other crises that are happening in the
world there have always been crises there will always be
crises the news has a tendency of focusing on the
worst of them the most dramatic of them the most
negative of them and if you're always immersed in that
you're feeding your brain something that is not nourishing to
it you're basically consuming junk food for the brain there's
a great book that was one of the first sort
of motivational self-help books that I read out there it
was called a hundred ways to motivate yourself by Steve
Chandler and they're one of his points was that you
need to wash your information intake and I thought this
was a brilliant idea and at the time that's where
I got this idea from is that I read that
and I said you know this makes a lot of
sense to me is that if I want to be
successful in my life and I want to create the
kind of awesome life that I want then I should
I should take the time to change just a few
habits it's not that difficult stuff like watching TV or
reading the news or following following that and replace some
of those negative sources of information or some sort of
like vacuous sources of information like a lot of reality
TV replace that with something educational and something nourishing and
so that's exactly what I did I cut out TV
I haven't really watched TV for about four years there
were stints where I went back onto TV but mostly
I cut cable I don't even own cable I do
watch I do like to watch movies and stuff but
I think that's very different than watching cable because cable
you kind of sit there and you become addicted to
it and you kind of almost get zombified by it
and hypnotized where you can sit there and literally go
through five hours of watching cable after work where you
totally you're totally brain-dead and you start feeling lousy about
yourself that's the kind of stuff you really really want
to avoid so cutting that out I think is a
good idea I still will watch a lot of video
lectures I still watch a lot you know movies TV
shows like high quality TV shows I still can watch
those and get a lot out of them like a
lot of HBO shows even though they're fictional they're dramas
there's still something there there's human psychology there that's a
play there's historical facts there that are interesting that stuff
can be used to boost your own motivation so that
stuff can be valuable but I still try to limit
it because ultimately the most nutritious sources of information are
things like books or going into school sitting in on
a lecture doing videos or maybe talking with with somebody
who's very knowledgeable about something that's a much better way
to nourish yourself or what I've been doing lately a
lot is doing more meditation and contemplation and journaling where
I sit there and I really have kind of a
conversation with myself about something that I'm that I'm struggling
with and get a lot of clarity just by analyzing
asking myself various questions it's a much better way to
get good quality data into your mind because your mind
on some level works very simply it takes in everything
that it sees around it right it takes in the
environment that's being fed to it and then it operates
on that what it does is there's mechanisms in your
brain that basically rearrange all the data that's coming in
and play around with it but if you're feeding it
bad data there's there's not that much that you can
do with it to turn it into something good so
if you want to have an awesome life feed yourself
valuable information feed yourself good data and what will happen
is that that kind of long-term investment it's a subtle
investment right you're not gonna you're not gonna immediately see
a huge payoff from from not watching cable anymore you're
not gonna immediately see the effects of that but over
the course of a couple of years you're gonna start
to notice that wow all of a sudden there you
have time to read 20 more new books and those
10 20 new books maybe one or two of those
books really resonate with you and give you some insights
some concepts some strategies that you can then go apply
and really change your life for the better plus you're
not feeling as bad about yourself now what I can
tell you about this is that doing it really you
can start if you're a cable watcher start by doing
a 30-day mental diet where you don't watch any cable
for 30 days straight it's tough you know those those
first few weeks are gonna be really really difficult and
you're gonna you're gonna rationalize to yourself all the reasons
why cable is is good for you like the fact
that it helps you on wine helps you relax after
a long day of work and so it does have
value in that regard and at first your body's gonna
resist it's gonna say well how am I supposed to
relax how am I supposed to unwind if if I
can't watch cable if I can't plop down on the
couch and just have a nice time you know reading
a book is not the same thing reading a book
is strenuous you put some labor into it you know
watching a lecture that's not interesting that's not fun I've
gone through this so it took me a couple of
attempts to really kick cable where I went kicked cable
for 30 days then I went back on it then
I kicked it then I went back on it but
eventually I'm at this point now I think it's about
four years since I've since I've really cut it out
and done this back and forth thing that now it's
it's it's effortless for me I really don't care about
cable I don't want to watch it I don't want
to look at it even when I'm at the gym
I don't want to even look at the monitors there
because I realized that none of that stuff is making
me productive none of that stuff is making me creative
it's not really helping my life that stuff is a
distraction and I don't want to be distracted by that
and I've built up a tolerance now for reading watching
high-quality material that I can find on the internet watching
lectures that that I purchase from various self-help authors out
there that kind of stuff right so that is what
you want to do is you want to start replacing
all the sources of of low-grade information with sources of
high-quality information stuff that will inspire you stuff that will
empower you and you'll notice that in the long run
that's going to be an awesome awesome awesome investment for
you so I encourage you to start by just analyzing
what are the one two or three sources right now
in your life of low quality information first of all
identify those sources whether it's TD or maybe it's hanging
out with with friends that that are not that are
not very intelligent or don't like to engage an intelligent
conversation so that you're just kind of going through idle
small talk that kind of stuff or the news that
you're reading maybe the newspaper that you're reading any of
that identify stuff that's distracting you stuff that's negative since
it's causing you to worry and stuff that's causing you
to focus your attention on things that are not about
you and then once you've identified a couple of those
find alternatives you know find an alternative for cable find
an alternative for your friends that that are not contributing
to to you in a meaningful way find an alternative
to to the newspaper do stuff that is fulfilling for
you and just like you would do that with your
body just like you would cut out junk food for
your body cut out junk food for your mind you
