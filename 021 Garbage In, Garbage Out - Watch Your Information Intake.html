            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/j3MQxCgNF5g' target='_blank'>Garbage In, Garbage Out - Watch Your Information Intake</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Information In versus Information Out</b>: Leo Gura explains that what we ingest physically and mentally affects the quality of our output. Consuming poor quality food can lead to health issues whilst consuming poor quality information can result in unproductive thinking or negative beliefs.
</li><li><b>Conscious Effort in Information Intake</b>: Over the past four years, Leo made a conscious effort to take in better quality information, expecting it to greatly improve his overall output. He uses the analogy of nurturing a plant and maintaining our physical health to emphasize that the quality of what we feed our minds with determines the quality of our thoughts and results.
</li><li><b>Television and News as Negative Information Sources</b>: According to Gura, television, especially cable TV, and news outlets are negative sources of information. He believes they do not offer beneficial knowledge and tend to focus on negative events that, often, are beyond our control.
</li><li><b>Leo's Personal Experience</b>: Gura used to keep up with the news and major talk shows for maintaining an awareness about politics and societal events. But he found it unrewarding and replaced it with richer sources of information. The freed-up time improved his overall life as he could now focus on personal growth and life building.
</li><li><b>Alternative Information Sources</b>: Leo puts forward the importance of replacing negative information sources like cable TV with more nourishing and empowering sources such as books, interesting discussions with friends, contemplation, meditation, educational lectures, and documentarie, and reducing the time spent on watching TV or reading newspapers.
</li><li><b>Reading News - A Negative Influence</b>: Gura suggests that staying updated on news doesn't directly contribute to individual growth since most events reported are out of our control and often focus on negative occurrences. He encourages focusing on personal growth and life goals rather than getting absorbed in worldly crises.
</li><li><b>Information Intake</b>: Leo stresses on the idea of monitoring our information intake. Drawing from a motivational book, "100 Ways to Motivate Yourself" by Steve Chandler, he says that the way we feed our brain and mind can significantly affect the success or improvement in our lives.
</li><li><b>Changing Consumption Habits</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of swapping habits like watching TV and reading the news, with consuming educational and nourishing content. He personally cut out cable TV and employed more productive activities such as watching video lectures and journaling.
</li><li><b>Impact of High-Quality Media</b>: He underlines the value in high-quality TV shows and films, as they offer insights into human psychology and historical events. However, he reminds viewers to still limit consumption and focus on more enriching sources like books or meaningful conversations.
</li><li><b>Quality of Information Matters</b>: According to him, the mind absorbs all that it sees and operates based on the consumed data. Therefore, feeding it with quality content results in more valuable outputs, enhancing personal growth and overall life quality.
</li><li><b>Long-Term Investment</b>: He acknowledges that abstaining from low-quality content like cable television doesn't yield immediate results. However, over a couple of years, the accrued time can be utilized for reading more books or other educating activities which could lead to noticeable life improvements.
</li><li><b>30-Day Mental Diet</b>: Gura suggests initiating this process by going on a "30-day mental diet", which involves not watching any cable for a whole month. He recognizes the potential for resistance due to the stress-relieving aspect of watching TV, but maintains that overcoming this hurdle can lead to a healthier mental lifestyle.
</li><li><b>Identifying and Replacing Low-Quality Sources</b>: He encourages viewers to identify and replace sources of low-quality information in their lives with high-quality alternatives. This could include replacing mindless TV watching with reading or partaking in intelligent conversations.
</li><li><b>Mental Junk Food</b>: Analogous to physical health, where one would eliminate junk food from their diet, mental health should also be prioritized by eliminating intake of detrimental or wasteful information. Making this conscious choice can contribute to a healthier and more fulfilling life.
