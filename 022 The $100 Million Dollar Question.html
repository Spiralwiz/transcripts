            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/4joMXQiImAY' target='_blank'>The $100 Million Dollar Question</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>The Hundred Million Dollar Question</b>: Leo from Actualized.org asks if you had $100 million dollars in your bank, what would you do with it? He encourages the viewer to truly visualize this scenario. Initially, you might indulge in expensive items, luxury holidays, or supporting loved ones. But after all material desires are fulfilled, what would you do? Leo argues this question bring us closer to understanding our true passions and purpose.
</li><li><b>Self-Development as a Major Goal</b>: Using himself as an example, Leo claims that despite material affluence, he would continue with his current actions - studying self-development, creating informative videos and aiding others with their self-improvement. He believes that it's crucial to find that meaningful endeavor or interest for every individual.
</li><li><b>Overcoming Financial Constraints and Fears</b>: The challenge lies in identifying what drives you and then having the courage to pursue it, despite possible financial restrictions or societal expectations. Leo aims to provide motivation, encouraging viewers to think beyond their financial constraints and societal obligations.
</li><li><b>Expressing Your Authentic Self</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of being authentic in every aspect of life as it allows an individual to tap into a unique flavor of genius not achievable by merely chasing money. He challenges his viewers to cast aside judgments and societal pressure to pursue their truest desires. 
</li><li><b>Taking Active Steps in Life</b>: Believing that fulfillment results from action, he emphasizes the need for everyone to discover what is truly satisfying and enjoyable for them. The goal should primarily be the embrace of life's rewarding aspects, such as personal development and meaningful engagement.
</li><li><b>Authentic expression</b>: Leo emphasizes the power of expressing oneself authentically, that is, being able to channel one's deepest values and passions into their work or career. This doesn't necessarily mean becoming an artist or an entrepreneur, but rather finding a job or a role that allows for the full expression of one's personality and values. Leo cautions that most people can't do this due to either financial constraints or lack of self-awareness.
</li><li><b>Deep soul-searching</b>: Leo believes that soul-searching is crucial to identify who you truly are and what your values are. Once you've identified your core identity, it becomes your true compass guiding your actions and pursuits. This process, however, is time-consuming and involves trying and testing different things without any fixed timeline.
</li><li><b>Practical challenges</b>: Even with a solid understanding of one's true self, there are practical challenges such as societal expectations, financial pressures, and others' opinions. Many might find it financially challenging to completely express themselves. Hence, it requires striking a balance between creative output and economic considerations.
</li><li><b>The power of courage and intellect</b>: To be financially rewarded for authentic self-expression, Leo encourages listeners to summon courage, utilize logic, intellect, and practical tools to navigate societal and financial pressures effectively, without being bothered about what others think.
</li><li><b>Long term endeavor</b>: Leo reaffirms that finding one's true self and a method for express it full is a complex puzzle that can take years, even more than a decade, to solve. It might require establishing a business which paves the way for financial independence and allows for desired self-expression.
</li><li><b>Impact of authenticity</b>: When aligned with oneÂ’s true self and expressing it authentically, individuals can achieve remarkable things and feel fulfilled, not because of the money they earn, but due to their ability to impact the world. Interestingly, financial success tends to follow when you are expressing yourself authentically as people are drawn to such unique offerings. 
</li><li><b>Ultimate Goal</b>: Leo's ultimate goal for the listeners is to identify their true self-expression and create an action plan to achieve it. Leo encourages the listeners to continuously think about and strive for their unique and true expression.
