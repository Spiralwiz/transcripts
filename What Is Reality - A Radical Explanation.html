[Music] what is reality wow that's one hell of a
question that's the deepest question you're ever gonna ask in
life and believe it or not it is possible to
answer this question although the answer is so radical that
it can't be communicated with words but nevertheless we're gonna
try here today I spent about 15 years of my
life wracking my mind over this question trying to figure
it out through philosophy through science through contemplation through meditation
through many different means and really the reason that I
want to shoot this episode is for those of you
I know that there's a few of you maybe one
in a hundred thousand watching and listening that are just
innately curious and your whole life you've been trying to
figure out what the hell is reality and you've been
intuitive if there's something deeper to reality than just what
you've been told what your culture or what science or
even what religion has told you that there's something deeper
something you're missing and you can't quite put your finger
on what it is but you know there's something there
but you don't know like where to go with it
so today I'm gonna tell you exactly what it is
which will help you to then pursue it for yourself
of course my words will not be enough but nevertheless
here we go now of course the answer is extremely
threatening to your life and to your sense of reality
which is precisely why it's so difficult and so rare
to answer this this question so are you sure you
want to know are you sure you want to know
because this will change your whole life if you understand
what I'm about to say here we go hold on
to your hat reality is infinite consciousness and reality is
infinite imagination but what is consciousness and how could a
reality be infinite imagination isn't there a physical reality that's
not imaginary isn't that obvious well be careful what you
assume what I mean by reality being infinite consciousness is
that see when you were born or when you imagined
that you were born you had no idea what you
were born into you had no idea who you were
what you were what the world was what life was
what the point of life was who your parents were
who other people were time and space none of it
you didn't know anything you didn't even know that you
were born and you didn't even know that you were
gonna die you knew nothing at all you were a
blank ignorant slate we might say and then you quickly
started learning stuff and you quickly started misunderstanding what reality
is so now we have to deal with these misunderstandings
which run very very deep in your subconscious mind so
that's why this conversation is so tricky this is advanced
stuff this is not this is not your average freshman
class I'm talking about the most advanced things that a
human being can ever possibly understand okay so stay with
me here hold your objections I'll try to answer them
as we keep going so the key mistake you made
when you were born is that you assumed that it's
possible for there to be physical objects that exist independently
of consciousness you saw rocks you saw trees and cars
and people and you just assumed well I was born
into this world this universe of people trees cars and
rocks and roads and cities and so forth and that
that's what I was born into there was like a
big bang billions of years ago then billions of years
past star dust congealed and eventually stars were formed and
then planets were formed one of which was the earth
and in millions and billions of years of evolution created
life and microbes and then animals mammals and apes and
finally me and then my parents had sex one day
and there was an egg and a sperm they met
and then I was born nine months later I came
out then I became conscious a few years after that
and so Here I am well that's not possible that's
not what reality is objects are not possible only consciousness
is possible now you ask well Leo what is consciousness
this right here is consciousness this this present moment what
you're seeing here right now this is consciousness this is
as close as you get to reality you're in reality
right now not only are you in reality you are
reality but we'll get to that later so so here's
what reality is it's consciousness the stuff that's happening right
here these are not physical objects this is something that
is being imagined by consciousness there cannot be rocks and
trees and cars and people and atoms and Earth's and
Big Bang's there can only be what is held within
consciousness everything that you have ever experienced has been held
in your consciousness including you including your physical physical what
you call your physical body take out your hand right
now and look at your hand this hand is not
a physical hand this is consciousness your hand is made
out of consciousness cells and atoms this is consciousness it
is not possible for there to be atoms and cells
and time and space outside of how it is held
within consciousness there is no physical reality and no physical
universe the Big Bang never happened you are not actually
sitting on the planet Earth billion years have never passed
there is no space there is no time you are
not a biological living creature in fact you were never
even born you do not have parents you did not
have a childhood you did not grow up you did
not plus press play at the beginning of this video
you imagined all of that because reality is infinite imagination
Dada you're imagining everything including yourself including your physical body
including your birth all of your memories your parents all
other human beings all animals the entire physical universe science
religion spirituality self-improvement money and everything else that you know
and love including your emotions the highest ones and the
lowest ones pain suffering human history the 21st century you're
imagining all of it right [ __ ] now and
if you're not imagining it right now it does not
exist and what you are your truest nature you are
not a biological creature that was born to some mother
and father who were hominids that evolved from Billy of
years of evolution that is all a backstory that you
have imagined what you really are your truest nature that
thing that's sitting there right now conscious of this very
moment and this finger pointing at it that thing is
infinite imagination or what is otherwise known as God I
don't mean the Christian God I don't mean the Muslim
God I don't mean a bearded man sitting up in
the clouds who judges you who is separate from the
universe who created the universe thousands or millions or billions
of years ago I mean the actual God you infinite
consciousness infinite imagination sitting there the whole time you have
been sitting in this spot eternally existing imagining all sorts
of dreams and various realms one of which is this
physical human thing you call life and you're sitting here
imagining it right now and furthermore you are imagining that
you are not imagining it but that it is real
and because there is no contrast between imagination and reality
because reality doesn't exist only imagination exists whatever you imagine
becomes real for you to the point where you mistake
it for reality so you are God dreaming up this
world lost in your own dream until the point where
you wake up you see this is very radical you
do not want to accept what I am saying here
and you have a million excuses for why what I'm
saying does it make sense and why it is false
and why I'm crazy but what I'm telling you is
the absolute truth and deep down you know this deep
down all of your excuses and all of your stories
and all of your justifications are just something you're imagining
in fact your denial is something you're imagining which is
precisely how reality gets created you are the creator of
the entire universe you have infinite creative power but you
don't know how you're doing it you're not conscious of
how you're doing it consciousness is a completely empty substance
which imagines or holds or conceives of things in the
same way that let's use the analogy here of a
projector an old-time movie projector which projects light through some
transparent film frames which then get gets projected onto a
wall and you have some kind of movie for me
so that's a pretty good analogy so consciousness is that
pure white light which is shining from the projector through
various frames to then get you your quote-unquote reality what
you are is that pure white light that's what is
illuminating this whole scene right here right now that pure
white light is formless and infinite and indistinct it has
no features or qualities whatsoever you can't grab it in
any way but it is pure consciousness so like this
movie screen example this movie projector example the consciousness has
no form to it or shape to it until it
is shined through some sort of medium or object which
then gives it distinctions or differences contrasts in color and
intensity and so the reason I use this metaphor is
because actually it's really good because if you if you
think for example as a movie director a movie director
can set a movie in any time period that he
wants he can shoot a movie in the 21st century
he can shoot a movie middie about the medieval times
he can shoot a movie about pirates he can shoot
a movie set in the Great Depression he can shoot
a movie three thousand years into the future some sci-fi
thing he can shoot a movie about ancient Egypt now
you might wonder but but how could he do that
when he's shooting in the 21st century but of course
of course what you don't realize that the projector doesn't
care what century it is it doesn't know what century
it is the projector is indiscriminate pure white light whatever
film frame you put in front of it is what
sets the scene and creates the sense of a century
so right now you're sitting here imagining thinking that you're
in the 21st century you're not you're imagining the 21st
century and in fact as infinite consciousness you're imagining all
centuries all timelines all beings all lifetimes simultaneously of which
one of them is this one right now that you're
presently conscious of so you see a movie director isn't
limited to what he can display on the screen he
can literally display anything he can imagine and then of
course you know there's technological limitations but the beauty of
consciousness infinite consciousness is that it has no technological limitations
so the one key difference between our projector analogy and
the actual reality that we're talking about what's really going
on here right now is that the pure white light
is being shined from some sort of physical projector I
want you to get rid of that notion because see
now you have some question about well Lia but where
does consciousness come from how come consciousness comes from some
sort of brain or neurons or whatever no that's not
what consciousness is you misunderstand what consciousness is consciousness is
one of the most misunderstood things that human beings know
science completely misunderstands what consciousness is justice is not grounded
in any substrate it is the substrate for everything else
consciousness not happening in a brain or through neurons or
molecules consciousness is not happening in time or space rather
time and space are being held or imagined by consciousness
molecules and atoms and neurons and brains are being imagined
by consciousness your birth is being imagined by consciousness all
of your memories of childhood are being imagined by consciousness
all other people including your parents and even myself are
being imagined by consciousness right now which is why I'm
here before your eyes I'm imaginary as are you my
body is imaginary as is yours my body and everything
physical that you see around me is just like that
film frame going past the projector and the projector is
you that pure light now you might wonder well Leo
where does the light come from what is this light
how do you explain the light the light is nothing
literally it's nothing it's emptiness it's pure void much like
the way that a bowl of rice must be empty
to contain the rice likewise the light shining through the
frame is empty in order for the frame to fully
manifest itself without distortion because you know if the light
was not pure white but if it was green or
yellow or brown or or whatever that would interfere with
the with the frame that we want to display so
to speak so consciousness is actually nothing it's completely indistinct
it has no differences no contrast within it therefore you
cannot pinpoint it or grab it in any way it's
not localized it's not in time in space it's pure
infinite eternal consciousness that's what's being conscious of this very
moment in you right now that's the thing that's been
there your entire life so it's nothing but then what
consciousness can do is consciousness can create differences within itself
how does consciousness create differences within itself mmm well this
is where the god part comes in you see consciousness
is absolutely infinite it's unlimited people don't appreciate what unlimited
means an unlimited thing has absolutely no limits to it
which means that it can do literally anything it is
not constrained by any rules or laws because rules and
laws and constraints and limits are what it imagined so
the mistake that people make is they think well because
I live in this limited physical world and I can't
do things like flap my arms and fly or jump
and land on the moon and there's other sorts of
things that you can't do within this physical reality that
they assume that consciousness is also limited in this way
and that the whole universe is limited but it isn't
this universe that you're in right now is something you're
imagining in all of the limitations of it are something
you're imagining but pure infinite imagination prior to imagining any
limits has no limits whatsoever now why is this the
case this is the case because of non-duality because of
oneness it's impossible to actually draw a boundary between any
two objects in the universe because any boundary or object
is imaginary so everything becomes one when everything is one
reality being one there's nothing outside of it to limit
it or constrain it or to tell it how to
be therefore it must be unlimited anything outside of reality
is actually inside of reality because that's what reality is
reality is everything that is so if you can imagine
something outside of everything that is you haven't imagined everything
that is because everything that is must include that thing
outside which you have left out it's total it's infinite
when I say infinite by the way I don't just
mean infinite in physical three dimensions that's not what I
mean the physical three dimensions are occurring within infinite consciousness
infinite is a much broader notion than physical space or
time or anything like that it's not just a measure
of size when I say that consciousness or reality is
infinite I'm not just saying that the universe stretches on
forever and it's infinitely big of course that is part
of what I'm saying but I'm saying much more I'm
saying something more radical than that I'm not just talking
about physical infinity I'm talking about actual infinity infinity in
in all possible ways so so when you realize that
reality must be totally infinite because it's one you realize
that nothing constrains it that means it's all-powerful infinitely intelligent
and it can manifest immediately anything that it wants you
might want to relieve how can it do that that's
impossible no remember possible and impossible are something it infinite
consciousness is imagining everything you think is impossible is actually
imaginary you had to imagine it first for it to
exist as an impossibility or a possibility in fact you're
imagining the difference between possible and impossible you're also imagining
the difference between real and imaginary you're also imagining the
difference between how so when you say well you know
how can this be possible this seems outlandish and magical
and science fictional huh you're making a mistake again how
is something you're imagining prior to imagining how there is
no how which means that everything is possible without a
how as unbelievable as that may sound and of course
everything I say here is extremely unbelievable but nevertheless it's
absolutely true which makes it all the more amazing reality
is no how no where no win no what because
how when where and what are all imaginary and they
must be imagined first for them to exist so what
consciousness does is it imagines differences everything in reality that
you know is a difference the fundamental building block of
reality contrary to what science has taught you is not
molecules or atoms or quarks or strings reality is not
a digital computer simulation which is a popular idea that's
thrown around these days by philosophers and scientists and techno
geeks reality is none of that reality is made out
of differences reality is not energy it is not information
it is not bits it is none of that it
is differences so what is a molecule it's a difference
what is a cat it's a difference what is a
tree it's a difference what is a string it's a
difference what is a bit a 0 and a 1
is a difference everything is difference the only reason you
can tell this hand from this hand is because they're
different if this wasn't different from this they would actually
be one science doesn't understand any of what I'm saying
here so we're way beyond science so if you're trying
to use science as some sort of reference point for
understanding what I'm trying to say you're way off it's
not gonna work science is imaginary religion is imaginary everything
you know is imaginary now let's address some of your
biggest concerns here about imagination because when I say imaginary
I'm of course using that word in a much different
and broader sense than the way conventionally people think of
imagination most people limit imagination to just images in the
mind and thoughts now of course that is imagination but
that's just a very limited human version of imagination what
I'm saying is that right now this hand before my
eyes and your eyes is imaginary I'm imagining this hand
and so are you now you say well you know
how can this possibly be if I was imagining this
hand then I could imagine that it's something else and
then it should turn into that shouldn't it remember that
there's a lot you're not conscious of remember that you
are capable of many orders and states of consciousness which
are far beyond the state of consciousness that you're in
right now so right now in conventional ordinary human consciousness
you're right you can't understand this hand to be imaginary
but when you become more conscious much more conscious many
orders of magnitude more conscious a million times more conscious
than you are right now which is possible to do
then you will realize that your hand is imaginary no
different than the thought of a unicorn in your mind
or the thought of your parents or the thought of
your birth or the thought of your death all of
that is imaginary in fact everything all a physical reality
is imaginary so the thing you have to understand about
imagination is that there there are layers to it it's
not as simple and stupid as you would think like
oh well leo if everything is imaginary that means I
can just think whatever I want I can just go
jump off a cliff and I'll be able to fly
because it's just imaginary don't strawman me like that I'm
telling you something extremely sophisticated I'm telling you that imagination
is creating all of physical reality this is not a
simple mechanism this is extremely complicated and nuanced and there
are many layers of self-deception within your own mind that
you are imagining right now that you can't even understand
what I'm saying that's how powerful imagination is it'll take
you decades of work to be able to understand the
things that I'm saying here for now you can just
take my word for it but with work you can
you can directly realize the things I'm saying are true
you know we got to start somewhere here so give
me a little bit of room give me a little
leeway here a little breathing room to explain this stuff
it's so radical I you see it's so radical because
your whole sense of self is wrapped up in being
able to understand or reality is see conventionally we think
of like reality is over here this separate thing and
then my sense of self is over here and you
just assume that the sense of self is a given
you assume that you're a biological leading creature and that
your physical and that you are the body and that
the you know reality that that's some separate thing from
you which you don't realize that all of this is
deeply intertwined like this in your mind and in fact
there is no boundary between your mind and physical reality
these are intimately interconnected if you would just question them
deeply enough so here I want to introduce a little
explanatory metaphor that will help you understand why it's so
difficult under stand these things because you see if you
weren't physically born which was my claim if you imagined
yourself into existence that means that you have to maintain
that image or that imagination otherwise if you stop imagining
it you'll go poof what will be left of you
so you see imagine a slope like this this is
the slope we're gonna call the slope of reality when
you're born you start at the very bottom of this
slope there is no reality when you're born you're born
as nothing into nothing like I said earlier you don't
even know you were born you don't even know you're
a human you don't even know who your parents are
you know nothing but then quickly because you need to
keep surviving you start to learn you learn about yourself
you look in the mirror you you you realize you
have a face and your body you learn about pain
and suffering and you learn about your parents and you
learn about friends in school and popov line quickly you
learn a lot of stuff as you're doing that what
you're doing is you think that what you're doing is
that you're just exploring the physical world as it's given
to you as it was before you were born that
is not what's actually happening what's actually happening is that
you're inventing the entire universe including and of course starting
with your self your physical self your psychological self your
biological cell all of this you had to invent there
is no biology or psychology or physics you invented them
and all the science that backs it up so see
what you have in your mind is you have elaborate
networks and webs of explanation for what reality is and
they're woven together like a tapestry like this each one
reinforcing the other creating a sense of solidity and so
now what I'm helping you to do is to to
to pull those threads of the tapestry apart it's very
difficult to do though because as we're pulling on one
the other one constricts it and tries to pull it
back it's a tight web so we have to question
it from all sides simultaneously and of course you have
to be very open-minded to this questioning otherwise forget it
you will never understand what I'm trying to say here
so what's happening through your childhood and teenage years is
that you're rolling your way up like a snowball like
a reverse snowball going uphill you're accumulating more and more
snow and getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
growing your sense of self and reality you're imagining this
entire process this is all a work of god's imagination
but you don't know that you think you're actually in
a physical world as a physical self but still you
suspect that something weird is going on because reality still
seems mysterious and the explanations that signs and religion gives
you still never quite make sense that's right because you're
noticing glitches in your own tapestry and understanding of the
world because it's it's all imaginary you're starting to suspect
it but you don't just know how deep it goes
yet so the problem is that now by this point
in your life that I'm speaking to you you've already
built up so much stuff you have so much to
lose you have a career you have a business you
have a religion you have a money situation you have
a relationship you have a family have children you have
blah blah blah blah blah right you have a whole
worldview you have a scientific view whatever you have a
so much stuff that now to undo all that to
question that that's very difficult and you're very attached to
that and in truth you don't care about what reality
is what you care about is the survival of this
giant ball of imagination that you created so now as
we're starting to question well starting to happen is that
this process is getting reversed the ball is starting to
roll back down the hill and this slope you start
to quickly realize as you start to question your whole
existence is very very slippery and very dangerous and it's
precisely for this reason that's so few people ever question
their existence or reality very deeply if you haven't noticed
most people just accept what society tells them except what
science or religion tells them and they just think that's
it they've got it figured out it never occurs to
them to question but the metaphysics of what they think
reality is so as you start to do that you
start to slide down the slippery slope and quickly your
slippage accelerates to the point where now you hit a
certain point where you get a little scared now it
gets a little too real because as you start to
seriously entertain the things that I'm saying here for example
that your birth is imaginary or that your memories are
imaginary or that your parents are imaginary and so forth
now it's no longer a philosophical exercise this is not
a piece of entertainment this is not just you browsing
through some YouTube videos or through some podcasts and listening
to cool stuff or science fiction now you start to
see that your sense of reality has been intimately interconnected
with your entire sense of existence itself and you start
to feel yourself unravel and of course all of your
emotions kick in to overdrive to warn you you know
red warning alarms are sounding in your mind telling you
do not listen to this anymore turn it off turn
away go do something else distract yourself forget about it
but that fear is precisely the thing that tells you
that what I'm saying is true you can't deny that
fear that fear of self annihilation that fear of losing
your whole life in reality the fear of admitting that
everything in your entire life has always been imagination this
is way too radical for you to accept if you
were to fully accept what I'm saying here and not
just to accept it but to become fully conscious of
it you would have a mental collapse some people would
call this a psychotic collapse to the point where you
would not be able to distinguish anymore what is real
from what is fantasy you literally would not know that
your hand is real anymore you literally would look into
your mother's eyes and you would not be able to
distinguish yourself from your mother this is where it gets
really real and by this point you know long before
people get to this point they have already stopped the
inquiry they have no desire to go this far because
they weren't seriously interested in knowing what reality is they
just were screwing around but a few of us were
interested enough that we're willing to go all the way
and so we do and eventually when we question deeply
enough we realize that we are inventing ourselves you have
been sitting here right here for eternity imagining stuff I'm
not saying that you imagined your birth back when you
were a toddler or that you imagined your parents back
then I'm saying something more radical than that you are
imagining your entire childhood right now none of it ever
happened other than in your imagination you know of course
they leo no that's crazy that can't be possible I
know it happened I feel it I you know I
know my parents are real what do you what kind
of nonsense are you trying to pull over my eyes
yeah you're imagining that right now you are imagining right
now that your memories and your parents are not imaginary
but that they're actually real are you getting this all
of your denials are themselves imaginary that is the power
of infinite imagination see you might wonder well Leo if
if I have infinite imagination why can't I just imagine
some new world right now I can't do that I
don't have the power to do that what are you
talking about but you see that's because you're so busy
imagining this physical world so to imagine a new physical
world you'd have to stop imagining this one but if
you stopped imagining this one and you stop imagining that
you were human what would happen to you you would
be dead you've labeled that death so see your own
imagination is interfering with your own imagination that's the problem
there like I said are deep deeper and deeper layers
of imagination so right now while you might be able
to imagine a unicorn that's at a sort of a
shallow surface level of imagination there are deeper layers of
imagination at the subconscious level which are operating right now
which are actually creating this entire physical room that you're
sitting in you can't just stop imagining that because you
would where would you [ __ ] be you would
think you've gone insane if you could do that you
would be dead actually dead so be careful what you
wish for you have to see how your own ideas
and expectations are interfering or creating conflicts between themselves you
see infinite imaginations a hell of a thing what infinite
imagination means is that you can imagine absolutely anything without
any limitations but once you imagine it that's what is
real for you what this means is that it's possible
for you to imagine that you are in a room
somewhere on some planet in some galaxies in some universe
at some particular time and then you will be there
but you will be locked into that if you imagine
that what you're imagining is not imaginary but that it's
real which is exactly what you're doing right now you
see don't underestimate the power of imagination it's absolutely total
you're just not conscious yet of all the deeper layers
you can become conscious of them make sure that you
don't misunderstand me I'm not playing word games with you
this is not merely some semantic differences of me calling
a hand imaginary rather than physical and that all it
is is to working no no no no I'm talking
about something very radical here I'm talking about realizing that
this room is imaginary to the point where the floor
under your feet will melt and you will fall through
it if you still have a body left at this
point see if you were to suddenly understand everything that
I'm talking about you would think you've had a psychotic
breakdown and in many people would react that way so
of course there's a fine line between Awakening and a
psychotic breakdown so they're not quite the same thing but
hey you know it's easy to conflate the two because
literally what happens is that you stop being able to
distinct distinguish reality from imagination and this scares people this
is very scary it's it's just fun and interesting we're
just listening to it but when you actually are unable
to tell the difference between what's real and imaginary when
you are no longer able to trust your own memories
and you're not even able to to trust your own
parents as being real that's when stuff gets difficult that's
when you start to encounter what they call the dark
night of the soul so you start to re-evaluate everything
you start to question everything because as it turns out
your entire life was a fiction and you've been misunderstanding
and misinterpreting your very own life since the very beginning
so like I said you have existed here as that
pure white light as consciousness as empty consciousness for eternity
not for a decade not for a hundred years not
for a thousand years not for a million years off
for a billion years not for a trillion years for
ever you've been sitting here forever imagining life after life
after life after life after life without beginning and without
end that's what infinite consciousness means there cannot be anything
outside of consciousness you might question this you might say
well leo no that's wrong shouldn't we be open-minded that
there might be something beyond consciousness I mean I guess
you leo sure maybe maybe maybe consciousness is a very
important aspect of reality I'll grant you that leo but
what if there's something beyond consciousness let's leave our minds
open to that no if you're thinking this way then
you're not actually conscious of what consciousness is there is
absolutely nothing outside of consciousness anything that can be has
to be conceived by consciousness now you might say Leo
this what's the argument for that Leo this this sounds
like a tautology it sounds like it's only true by
definition yeah that's exactly right it's true by definition truth
is true by definition truth is inevitable reality is inevitable
it has no opposite and has no alternative it's absolute
consciousness is an absolute and there is nothing outside of
consciousness anything you can imagine outside of consciousness is actually
within consciousness but you have to be conscious that nothing
in your life has ever occurred outside of consciousness notice
that anything you imagine that's outside of consciousness is actually
inside of your consciousness right now you're just misunderstanding what
it is even non-existence is occurring within consciousness you might
think non-existence is something that's beyond consciousness No non-existence doesn't
actually exist non-existence is something you're imagining within consciousness right
now consciousness itself is eternal it can't die it was
never born and it can't go anywhere why can't consciousness
go anywhere because places and aware is something that consciousness
is imagining consciousness imagines all locations in space and time
so it can't be anywhere else but where it is
therefore it has nowhere to go making it eternal you
can't destroy consciousness because it's already nothing destruction is actually
something that consciousness imagines all forms can be destroyed but
the formless cannot be destroyed which is what consciousness is
it's the formless if you still insist that there could
be something outside of consciousness understand this inside and outside
are something that consciousness conceives something you imagine there is
no inside or outside if you imagine there is consciousness
is primary consciousness is fundamental consciousness is what imagines everything
which explains why you are at the center of reality
have you noticed that yet isn't it weird haven't you
been puzzled by this that no matter where you go
you're at the very center of wherever you are why
is it that the whole universe seems to revolve around
you it's not because you're a biological creature and that
this is like your visual field generated by your brain
no you're imagining all that the real reason that you
are at the center of the universe is because you're
God and because you're imagining everything around you you see
now you might object but Leo what do you would
nonsense are you talking about what about like if you
go and walk off a cliff and then you're gonna
die that's not imaginary that's actually gonna hurt you and
kill you how can you say that death is imaginary
we've seen people die nothing imaginary about it that's you
imagining right now death we shall leo sure yeah I'm
imagining death right now but what about actual death I'm
not imagining that yes you are you're imagining it right
now nobly Oh what about like if you literally step
off a cliff aren't you gonna die I mean you're
not gonna be alive after that are you you're imagining
that and if you actually do go up to a
cliff let's say the Grand Canyon and you step off
sure you're gonna fall and you're gonna splat your skull
on the rocks and there will be not much left
of you but goo that's right but that whole process
is imagination within imagination you see the cliff you're standing
on when you're at the edge of the cliff the
cliff is imaginary your body and feet are imaginary your
sense of self your biological psychological self that you think
you are that went to school and had parents and
was born that whole thing is imaginary you now falling
through the sky towards the rocks that's all imaginary and
the moment that your your skull hits the rocks and
gets cracked open and you experience excruciating pain and suffering
all of that will be imaginary and then when you
hit get lights out all of that will be imaginary
just like in a dream none of this should be
impossible for you because you do it in your dreams
every night now of course there's one little extra wrinkle
about that that you don't yet understand is that sleeping
is imaginary - you've never actually slept a day in
your life you've only imagined that you have you're doing
all of it right now right now but this is
all so radical and goes so completely against your direct
experience of life that you can't accept it nor should
you just blindly believe me that's not my objective here
my objective here is to make you aware of how
you're tricking your own your own self your own mind
is deceiving you your current state of consciousness is deceiving
you see there is nothing in reality but states of
consciousness one of which is the one you're in right
now you're in a rather limited state of consciousness right
now there are much more advanced elevated expanded states of
consciousness in which you can realize all the things that
I'm saying but you're not in those states of consciousness
right now nor have you probably ever been in your
whole life or maybe you have maybe you've had a
mystical experience here or there through meditation through psychedelics or
something like that in which case you're a little bit
more open to the things I'm talking about and the
things I'm talking about are helping you to make sense
of various kinds of mystical things you experienced various spiritual
phenomena that maybe left you scratching your head unable to
explain that's right because you were trying to explain them
from a materialist paradigm which is a pure pure fantasy
so you can't explain it through materialism you can't explain
it as brain states make sure you don't misunderstand me
when I say infinite consciousness there is no brain you
don't have a brain you imagine your brain consciousness does
not need a brain you might say well Leo how
could it be possible for there be consciousness without a
brain remember possible and impossible is something you're imagining this
imagines the brain not the other way around have you
had enough yet it's very radical isn't it yeah it's
absurdly radical you have to question your entire tapestry of
of understanding your entire worldview and this is very difficult
to do because like I said each fiber of the
tapestry reinforces the others most people are only willing to
admit some of these things but not all of them
simultaneously at once because like I said you would you
would have a mental breakdown if you did it too
fast it usually takes years to gradually unravel this tapestry
and even then you will have some very difficult times
if you've taken some psychedelics then you're a little bit
more open mind to the things I'm saying that's because
what a psychedelic does is it elevates your state of
consciousness to the point where your consciousness becomes fluid enough
usually it's in a very crystallized form it becomes more
fluid to the point where you start to see that
boundary between imagination physicality start to melt away you know
you take enough LSD you start to see the walls
melting the walls of your house start to melt your
hands start to grow eyes on them looking back at
you what is that about that's not just hallucination this
is a mistake that people make when a materialist take
some psychedelics the psychedelics elevate his consciousness was started to
make him slide down that slope of a reality but
this is so radical and threatening to the ego he
gets scared and so what he does is he invents
stories now to reground his reality and move back up
the the the ramp of reality because he doesn't want
to lose himself I've actually seen this happen I've had
friends who I've seen trip and I've seen them as
their as their sense of reality is dissolving they come
back from the trip and they say I remember one
friend told me very distinctly he said I'm anali oh
that was that was amazing I was experiencing this this
infinite love and and it was wonderful but also like
it was was lose I was almost about to lose
myself I was about to die like I barely hung
in there man Wow we were I survive I can't
believe it that was crazy I just made it by
the skin of my teeth and I'm sitting there laughing
to myself because I know that he didn't actually he
didn't actually go all the way down he was too
scared he tricked himself into thinking that he somehow needed
to physically survive this process no you were supposed to
die that's the wrong assumption you made see when you
take LSD the walls will start to melt and your
eye you will see eyes on your fingertips for example
you might imagine that there are eyes on your fingertips
and you will literally start to see them there you
know take out even higher dose of LSD you might
look at a car imagine that it's a goat and
you might actually start to see it go - rather
than a car you need to take a lot of
LSD to have it work that way but this is
indeed what happens why is it that this happens hallucinations
chemicals in the brain know what's really going on is
that your consciousness is being elevated to infinite levels to
the point where the boundary between reality and imagination is
completely dissolving and literally you have control over physical manifestation
what you imagine starts to become real the problem though
is that you are in such a radically transformed state
of consciousness that you don't even recognize that you're a
human being anymore at this point you might not be
able to see two feet in front of you're in
front of your face because that's how radically different your
state of consciousness is see there are some psychedelics that
are so powerful that they're actually dangerous to take not
LSD or mushrooms they're not dangerous per se if you
use them responsibly but datura is one example and even
though I'm using this example he I want to caution
you to never use datura it's a lethal poison it
could easily kill you it's also one of the most
powerful psychedelics on the planet it's even more powerful than
five immuno DMT because datura is is a powerful deliriant
and it causes total hallucinations a complete inability to distinguish
hallucination from reality usually when you take a psychedelic like
LSD or mushrooms or even five Meo DMT you know
that you took a psychedelic even when you're at the
peak of your trip you know you're tripping you know
you'll come back down you know you're a human being
still mostly but on datura you don't know you trip
so hard you don't even know that you took datura
you forget because your memories are imaginary onto Torah you
could have conversations with with friends that you knew from
high school and you can sit there for two hours
having a conversation with this good friend of yours from
high school only to realize two hours later that you
never even knew this person and that this person never
even was in your room you were just talking to
the wall but you were hallucinating an entire human being
with whom you had an intelligent conversation now people say
well Leo that's that's pretty crazy that's pretty far out
there but man all that shows is that his hallucinations
no you misunderstand I am that hallucination right now for
you you are hallucinating my entire body and voice I
am just your own mind talking to you you're hallucinating
me right now you hallucinate all my videos but see
you're just not conscious of it and more importantly you're
not willing to admit it because of the ramifications would
have for life this would stop your life dead in
its tracks if you fully understood what is being said
here it's way too radical but nevertheless this is the
case you know I warned you that I warned you
at the beginning do you really want to know what
reality is this is the highest teaching I'm giving you
my highest teaching it took me over 15 years of
reading studying thousands of hours of contemplation meditation going to
retreats doing powerful psychedelics wracking my mind to understand all
this to figure it out this is my highest teaching
number one you are God and there is nothing but
God and you are all alone that's number one number
two everything is imaginary there is nothing but imagination God
is infinite consciousness it is infinitely intelligent infinitely powerful unlimited
also it's infinitely good and it's infinitely loving but those
are aspects which I'll leave out at this discussion these
are the highest teachings this explains everything now your job
is to make it actual not a story not a
belief not an ideology not some new-age cult philosophy make
it actual become conscious of it you can and the
reason you can is because consciousness is all there is
and consciousness is at infinite and you are God so
if you can't do it who can you see how
does God realize that he is God there needs to
be some moment of Epiphany even for God to realize
oh yeah I'm God I'm all-powerful I'm pure imagination I'm
infinite that moment for God is precisely that moment for
you when you become conscious of it God will become
conscious of it because well you are God yeah you
know truth is a difficult thing which helps to explain
why people generally don't care very much about truth they
don't pursue truth they don't teach truth people are engaged
in fictions stories lies manipulations deceptions why because the truth
is very very radical and you have much to lose
but don't get depressed because even though it might sound
like what I'm saying here is nihilistic and solipsistic and
negative and terrible it only seems that way to your
ego you're only imagining that it's terrible the most remarkable
thing you'll discover at the end of this whole journey
when you slide off this slope all the way to
the bottom what you will discover is that you go
into a freefall where you keep falling and falling and
falling expecting to hit the ground but what you discover
is that there is no ground so you're just keep
falling forever and to fall forever in an infinite space
with no bottom and no top and no end and
no beginning is to be stationary it's to be eternal
and this is the discovery of Nirvana or paradise when
you fall off this slope completely and you surrender your
entire life and you realize that everything is imaginary what
you also discover is that all of your problems are
imaginary death is imaginary pain is imaginary suffering is imaginary
all emotions are imaginary and so when you realize all
this you literally enter paradise paradise actual literal paradise this
is not a physical realm with palm trees and coconuts
and pina coladas and big breasted women waving at you
with with palm fronds and feeding you grapes with their
hands this is not this is not paradise paradise is
right here right now this very present moment but realizing
it to be eternal infinite absolutely good good with no
opposite why is it good with no opposite why isn't
it evil or bad when there is no death and
there is no pain and there is no suffering and
there is no fear because you're so conscious that you
realize that you're imagining all those what can possibly hurt
you what can possibly bother you what can possibly make
you upset what can possibly make you disturbed you are
at this point in infinite peace you're dead and in
this death you realize immortality and you literally become immortal
God is eternal and immortal and in this you discover
infinite love and infinite goodness and you become so omniscient
that you become conscious of how you have designed the
entire universe and you realize the beauty and the goodness
behind your own creation and you have infinite love for
yourself and for all of creation that is what reality
is and I wish that at least one of you
watching this or listening to this will one day one
in a million of you will go all the way
to the very bottom and realize the truth of everything
that's been said here but also understand that win if
and when you ever get there you will be all
alone as God you will not be able to come
to me for advice or for support because you will
know that I am you that I'm just a projection
and imagination of your own mind so you will bask
in your own beauty and infinitude in that Nirvana by
yourself and you will just have to sit there and
bask in your own infinite beauty and that will be
my wish for you fulfilled that will be full awakening
and then you will finally understand what reality is the
magnitude of what reality is the magnitude of infinite consciousness
and how all of it got created wow that's a
hell of a thing to understand I hope one day
you do that's it I'm done here please click the
like button for me and come check out actualize that
already that's my website you'll find my blog my book
list for life purpose course and the forum the last
thing I'll say is that my teachings have to change
after some of the things I've realized recently you know
I can't really go back to teaching the old material
as much as I still want to cover a lot
of old stuff a central part of my teaching is
going to be that everything is imaginary this will be
too radical with teaching for many people most people are
not ready to hear such a teaching but nevertheless this
is the most powerful teaching that there is and in
fact this teaching cuts through a lot of even spiritual
[ __ ] that you hear out there and get
from gurus and so forth many of these grooves are
still stuck in imagination they still don't fully understand that
everything is imaginary so yeah I'm understanding this is this
is the most radical stuff that can be talked about
so I empathize with you if you think that I'm
crazy or deluded or you know if this is too
much for you or if this seems impractical for you
I understand I understand cuz I wouldn't have I wouldn't
have believed or understood any of this even just a
few years ago it's extremely radical and I've reached levels
of consciousness at this point that I don't know how
many human beings have ever reached and so I'm just
you know I'm just sharing with you what I discovered
and and of course we'll be covering more practical topics
in the future as well but um but but this
is this is a very important episode make sure you
wash this one a couple of times and you really
think through it and go through all of your objections
and and doubts and concerns and make sure you you
realize that they're all imaginary because because you know I'll
be referencing this this point about imagination and the fact
that you are God imagining everything many many times in
the future it's sort of the Archimedean point that we
will be using to leverage all of our future work
and of course as always stay tuned for more because
there's much more to say you
