hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm gonna rant about how society [ __ ]
you in the ass and how society exploits your lower
self and distracts you from living an authentic life I've
got some bad news and I've got some good news
for you let me begin with the bad news I
think it's very important that you understand what society actually
is this Western culture that most of us are growing
up under you got to start to understand what's really
going on in Western mainstream culture right now we're in
the era of modern capitalism if you're familiar with the
graves model of psychological stages then this is stage Orange
what does this mean stage orange it basically means that
business is shaping Society culture government science religion and everything
else there is no facet of society which is not
touched very heavily by business and that's a problem it's
a problem because what business and marketing people are doing
and they are experts at this is they are architecting
systems to trap your lower self this is what characterizes
modern business let me repeat carefully methodically architected and optimized
systems to trap your lower self you get trapped into
low consciousness patterns why because this is good for business
and because you are so unconscious and you are so
willing to go towards the low consciousness stuff that this
is where the best business is very little business is
in high consciousness stuff so what entrepreneurs and CEOs and
savvy business people do is they create these systems they
build their entire life around creating these systems and these
leaders on the one hand they're quite crafty and they're
quite intelligent and they're quite smart and they're very capable
and they're very efficient and they're very hardworking but on
the other hand they're actually very ignorant and clueless they're
creating these systems but it's not like they're an evil
genius creating these systems now see they themselves are stuck
in low consciousness patterns and their entrepreneurship is actually fueled
by low consciousness because what they're fueled by is by
money power progress and greed and other neurotic drivers the
same way that you are and they're exploiting these drivers
in you but also they're kind of exploiting themselves and
they're ignorant of this whole thing so this is what's
going on it's a game that's rigged against you and
it's a game that's rigged against the people who are
creating the game and this is something you have to
start to become aware of if you really want to
take control of your life I don't know if you've
noticed this but right now in society and in business
there's an all-out war for eyeballs businesses their number-one priority
is to capture eyeballs this is what marketing is about
in the heart of every business is their marketing why
eyeballs eyeballs is attention businesses need your attention to sell
you stuff if they don't sell you stuff they die
if they don't get your attention they die they pay
millions and billions of dollars for eyeballs or they find
some crafty way to get your attention have you noticed
all the ads around you on the internet off the
internet as you're driving to work as you're at the
supermarket wherever you go there's ads these ads are fighting
for your eyeballs why eyeballs because eyeballs directly equate to
power power directly equates to money and all of this
is done in the name of progress and you're caught
in the middle of this whole war in fact you
grew up you were born in the middle of this
war and you were a child growing up in the
middle of this war and you were an adolescent growing
up in the middle of this war and you're probably
an adult living in this war and you're gonna die
a senior citizen in the middle of this war most
people go through all these stages they're not even aware
of this battle that's going on around them or maybe
they're involved in the battle because they actually are a
marketer or entrepreneur here's what you gotta understand about how
this works is that your brain actually has different levels
and parts in it and there's something that I like
to call the chip parts of your mind the chimp
parts of your mind are those parts of your brain
which are basically not the prefrontal rational human cortex that
is developed but the stuff earlier on from evolution that's
still in your mind that still runs and governs most
of your behaviors in life this is the stuff that's
irrational illogical this is the stuff that rules chimps if
you go and you study chimpanzee behavior and you see
what chimps are predominantly concerned about in their troops what
you learn is it's all of these things that I'm
about to show you and so what these businesspeople and
marketers do what modern capitalist is about is about creating
traps and systems that exploit these chip parts in your
brain and so basically what it turns out to be
is it turns out to be ego banking off of
ego the people on the top have ego and they're
using it to Bank off of your ego so what
are these chip parts well here's the basics of it
salt sugar fat sex your mind is pradana and by
thinking about sex you dream about it you think about
throughout the day you look at magazines for it you
don't even know how much you think about sex you
don't even acknowledge it to yourself but you do and
you're highly driven by sex same thing with salt sugar
and fat that's the entire food industry right there is
encapsulated in those three things salt sugar fat also another
chimp part of you is the need for power and
Status chimps if you study their behavior if you read
some books about them what you learn is that they're
all about power and Status who's at the top of
the hierarchy who's in the bottom who's rising who's falling
who has more prestige and status than the others who's
plotting who to overtake whom that's a chip part in
your brain and a lot of marketing and business systems
are designed to appeal directly to that there's also fun
and play and entertainment there's another chimp part of your
mind you like to play you like to be entertained
you'd like to be stimulated and titillated and excited all
this is basically fun and everything is tried to be
sold to you through this one part right here fun
entertaining exciting right we've got billions and billion dollar industries
that cater just to this one chip part also validation
there's the the chimp part and you that likes to
be validated that likes it's ego stroked that likes approval
that likes people to like it and to need it
to to want it into to shower it with praise
well that's also exploited there's also a chimp part of
you that likes security and comfort oh yeah you really
like your security and comfort except that security like it's
actually a false security so that is also catered to
in the marketplace also love love was a real good
one you love love you can't live without love except
this is a lower self kind of love this is
not higher self love the kind of love that you
want this is like a needy desperate neurotic form of
love an escape really from from reality from true love
from authenticity and from truth so this is something you
kind of just give yourself away to so you can
escape from the rest of the world and then another
chimp part of you is vanity your vanity your ego
your pride your arrogance so that part is exploited very
commonly and then lastly is gossip chimps love to gossip
they love to talk about who's gonna overtake who they
like to scheme they like to learn about who's having
sex with whom and who's backstabbing whom and who's having
fun and where's all the good food where can I
get some false security who has more validation than me
and so on and so forth that's gossip so those
are some of the chimp parts of your mind and
these are mechanisms that function unconsciously in you that's why
they're so lucrative for business people to exploit is because
you're very bad at controlling these mechanisms in your mind
you probably don't even recognize that these mechanisms exist in
your mind and so if I can serve you up
some product or some service that hits one of these
things or multiple of these things a combination then you're
gonna pull out your wallet because what these marketers and
business people have learned is that you don't buy [
__ ] unless the thing I'm selling you hits one
of these pain points or one of these pleasure points
of the lower self all of these things are of
the lower self nobody really targets your higher self so
just something to be aware of as you're going through
and you're drinking from the cup of mainstream culture now
what I want to do is I want to give
you 30 specific examples of ways in which businesses and
society exploit your lower self so there's a lot of
them so I'm gonna have to go through them pretty
quickly here they are here's the list very eye-opening list
food the entire food industry from restaurants to the junk
that they sell you at supermarkets and everything else is
all geared to appeal to your lower chimp self and
to ruin your health alcohol and drugs obviously the the
medicine and pharmaceutical industry huge into appealing to your lower
chip self how about the college and schooling and education
industry so especially this whole system that we have going
especially here in the US where you're studying for colleges
should get into the best colleges the Ivy League schools
and you're trying to get into the most prestigious ones
and you try to take the best tests and you
have to prepare for those tests and you buy books
and manuals and all this and then the whole academic
game that is played in academia in these high-end universities
so that entire system is just all about appealing to
the chimp lower self how about celebrities following celebrities watching
them being curious about them reading up on them gossiping
about them tabloid magazines all of that books there's a
lot of good books but also there's a lot of
chunk books out there and most people they don't read
the good ones they read the junky ones which appeal
again are they're lower chip self romance novels all those
vampire novels all the other sci-fi novels and fantasy novels
and all this crap all this is just appealing to
your lower chimp self how about video games that entire
industry I was part of that in that entire industry
is just one giant treadmill of chimp behavior how about
TV shows you love your TV shows Breaking Bad Game
of Thrones Big Bang Theory what are you guys like
whatever you like all that [ __ ] is just
pure symptom it's just chimps interacting with our chimps it's
chimps in a cage is what it is prime example
Game of Thrones why do you think you like Game
of Thrones so much Game of Thrones out of all
the shows that I watch Game of Thrones is the
most ingeniously designed show to appeal to the lower chimp
and you what is Game of Thrones it's basically chimps
murdering backstabbing raping and pillaging and overthrowing other chimps that's
all Game of Thrones is in a nutshell but it's
so good right oh yeah Game of Thrones is really
good especially that little that little guy little dwarf chimp
yeah he's a real entertaining isn't he you know how
about the news industry you're familiar with a 24-hour news
cycle and all the chimp dumb that goes on in
their prime example I don't think I need to say
much more about that how about social media pure temporary
the whole thing is just chips chattering with other chimps
it's just cheap chatter it's monkey chatter they need to
rename Twitter and call it monkey chatter cuz that's what
it really is how about the whole internet all the
memes all the [ __ ] that goes on on
the internet all chip chatter popular culture is just cheap
chatter how about what you do with your friends when
you go out and you socialize and hang out with
your friends and you talk [ __ ] and all
that gossip with them chimp chatter about the status game
that you play chimps play the same status game you
think you're much more evolved than chimp you're not you
think you dress yourself in a what is it to
three-piece suit and then you put on your fancy watch
and you go to the fancy restaurant with your fancy
trophy girlfriend or whatever and you're driving your fancy car
this is all status game it's pure temporary how about
porn pure chipper you're just a chimp in a zoo
cage jerking himself off that's what you are how about
shopping how about fashion getting the latest clothes and looking
cool playing the status game that way who's the coolest
chimp are you the coolest chimp are you the second
coolest chimp maybe you're not even there yet how about
the whole tech bubble trend all the technology gadgets all
the tech news you read the newest iPhone this phone
that gadget the watch the this the that the hottest
computer or whatever little Christmas gadget you're buying your mom
for Christmas this year all that [ __ ] the
Fitbit and all that crap what is going on there
that's just temporary - it's all chimp eree done in
the name of progress but it's all chipper II how
about the financial markets especially credit loans mortgages credit cards
are you seeing all these credit card commercials with these
actors and celebrities now the Capital One and all this
[ __ ] what is that that's appealing to your
lower chip self - want to get something for nothing
nightclubs purely for chimps it's basically a zoo for chimps
with dance music how about this trend with cars that
I never get this these guys who care about the
car that they drive like they really love their car
they want a sports car like a Porsche or Ferrari
or some [ __ ] this is this is complete
idiocy complete symptom how about holidays all the marketing during
the holidays for Christmas and for Thanksgiving and for Halloween
and for Valentine's Day all this [ __ ] this
is all chipper II what about politics all politics is
just isn't it isn't it just like two cages of
chimps side by side of the zoo flinging [ __
] at each other isn't that what politics really is
I think that pretty much sums it up there how
about and religion is like a a chimp walking out
on stage dressed in a pope hat and a robe
carrying a scepter thinking that he's somebody that's what religion
basically is and man they they really perfected it over
the the centuries that they've had to practice that one
that's like old school old school chimp them right there
how about marriage you think marriage is good you think
marriage is immune to this no what is modern marriage
modern marriage is so that instead of you self developing
and going looking for truth and finding your authentic self
no instead of doing that what you do is you
go and you get married and marriage Deleuze you to
thinking you can escape actual personal growth and sound so
now you escape into marriage but this mayart marriage what
is this marriage this marriage is just temporary you're just
being two chips thinking that you're doing something but you're
just you're squawk an inch on like two chimps that's
what your marriage is how's it working for you by
the way you happy with that fulfilled yet how about
romance this whole narrative of romance that you're fed by
some mainstream society same deal it's the same deal it's
basically an escape complete appeal to your lower self you
think that you're falling in love but you're not falling
in love you're just being a chimp you're a horny
little chimp you're a neat little chip your desperate little
chip that just wants someone who's gonna take care of
them who's gonna who's gonna need them so that you
can forget about all your problems in life that's what
romance is to you really how about family what's family
life all about you think family is very noble and
high consciousness no family is the most no consciousness [
__ ] it's just a troupe of chimps you know
chimps like to [ __ ] so they produce baby
chimps and then it's just chimps with their baby chimps
and then they're all getting into crazy antics together and
all of them are running on their own patterns their
own loops all of them are stuck all of them
are dysfunctional and it's just like this dysfunctional sitcom of
chipton that's what family is what about the typical career
the typical nine-to-five career pure chim pre you go in
there you do your chip stuff probably a chimp could
you your job you don't really care about what your
job is doing what kind of output or impact it's
having on society you're not thinking about any of this
stuff you're acting like a chip you're using your chimp
career to fuel all the chip behaviors see the chimp
career is real important because if you have a chip
career that means you can get all the other chimp
stuff I've been talking about how about the stock market
oh man I love to rip on this one the
stock market Wall Street all these [ __ ] financial
companies that are sprouting up everywhere have you seen all
these ads for financial companies everywhere have you gone to
a downtown area in your local city or in a
major city in the US I was in Miami a
few weeks ago for a vacation I was walking through
the downtown area blew me away that every single skyscraper
in Miami is owned by a [ __ ] uh
kind of Wall Street financial services company what are these
companies doing all they're doing is they're exploiting they're exploiting
your your [ __ ] symptom and then of course
they themselves are the biggest chimps so you go to
some fancy restaurant in Uptown and you're you're sitting there
with all these Wall Street chimps and these Wall Street
chimps you know they have a nice suit they walk
in there with a trophy girlfriend they're pulling up in
there and they're BMW SUV or some [ __ ]
like this and they're sitting there and they're you know
they're sipping their wine they're having their their stupid business
conversations this is all chimp them this is all pure
ego low consciousness [ __ ] and lastly oh man
this one is is real chipped um it's sports professional
sports what is professional sports it's like the most low
consciousness [ __ ] that you could possibly invent and
yet it's like billions and billions of dollars this industry
people rooting for their home [ __ ] teams loyalty
to your team that you grew up in what is
what is have to do the sports team that you
root for and the town you rep like what's the
[ __ ] connection it's just pure stupidity pure symptom
going on there so that rep wraps up the list
that's thirty items for you right there think long and
hard about just what impact all this stuff has in
your life and how much it's shaped the trajectory of
your life over the last 10 20 30 40 years
a lot a lot a lot a lot so what's
happening in all these is that your lower chimp parts
are being exploited and you're being kept in this kind
of vicious cycle of low consciousness in all these different
facets of life and what this allows you to do
is it allows you to let go it allows you
to follow the path of least resistance basically it makes
your life real easy and convenient and fun and exciting
and you listen to this list and you I hear
you say something like well believe you know some of
the stuff I hear yeah it's kind of bad but
sometimes other stuff you talked about you know I like
it I like my Game of Thrones and I like
my restaurant you know I like my my hot girlfriend
and I like some of the southern I like my
sports team and what's wrong with this stuff look I'm
not pointing my finger at you as though I'm holier-than-thou
as though I'm not part of any of this you
know I've fallen onto all these traps myself I speak
about them because I've been in them and you know
what you know it's it's been a real effort to
pull myself out of this stuff but the more I
do the more I realize like what the [ __
] is going on do you realize what the [
__ ] is going on yeah you like this stuff
because you're [ __ ] chimp and those chimp arts
of you being exploited but there's also the higher part
of you which isn't being tapped that you need to
wake up to you need to wake the [ __
] up to the idea that all of this that
I've been talking about this is all an escape it's
all a sham it's all an escape Society what is
it really it's an amusement park for the ego that's
what modern society is it's it's nothing else once you
start to study the ego and how it works a
little bit you start to open your eyes you see
holy [ __ ] every every little piece is just
an amusement park for the ego to do what to
distract you from looking inward to distract you from looking
inward notice that all these things are all about pointing
you outward look outward don't look inward the distraction is
from truth you're being distracted from truth you're being distracted
from being conscious of your own death the shortness of
your own life and you're being distracted from the lies
you tell yourself because you're not living a real life
you're being distracted from living a real life to not
live a real life you need to lie to yourself
and you need to distract yourself constantly and that's exactly
what all these different industries do is they keep you
in constant distraction and constantly lying to yourself and pacifying
yourself and narcotized in yourself society's aims are as follows
achievement progress power efficiency and status quo those are society's
aims those are not your aims at least they shouldn't
be your aims have to be finding your authentic self
society and business generally does not give a [ __
] about helping you find your true authentic self they
don't give a [ __ ] about truth because truth
is antithetical it's really antithetical to achievement in progress truth
is about being not about doing society is all about
doing business is all about doing because doing is an
activity is a distraction from being to be being you
have to be still you have to be silent business
and society is all about commotion and motion and noise
that's what it is it doesn't care about helping you
to be it cares about keeping you business you know
busy which is busyness right business busyness busy you're always
busy busy but not being not being true to yourself
you have found yourself and that's why you're unsatisfied that's
why you're unfulfilled with all this progress and achievement all
you get the more you get the more dissatisfied you
are the only times you're satisfied is when you're being
when you're being authentic when you're finding the truth your
true aim in life should be to find your true
self not achievement and progress and power and efficiency don't
get those confused so that's the bad news it's a
lot of bad news if you remember I started off
saying that I have some bad news for you and
some good news well that was the bad news now
I got some good news the good news is short
and simple the good news is this is that it's
fully in your power to avoid these traps we're not
living in North Korea if you are then you wouldn't
be watching this video so that means that you have
the power to avoid many of these traps business makes
it very easy for you to fall into the food
trap the porn trap the shopping trap the sports trap
the Wall Street trap all these traps but you know
what if you just summon a little bit of consciousness
and awareness then you can avoid all of them if
you can discipline yourself a little bit if you can
start actualizing yourself a little bit then you can easily
avoid many of these traps and in doing that what
you're gonna do instead is you're going to design a
healthy conscious lifestyle where you're really alive and your life
is about finding the core of who you are peeling
back the layer after layer on the onion to get
to the very core of who you are that should
be your sole concern in life not the distractions you're
living with right now so this is good news because
it means that you ultimately have all the power no
one has chained you no one has really oppressed you
all it takes to some awareness and some care if
you care about your own life if you care about
living a meaningful extraordinary authentic life if you care about
truth if you value these things and you keep your
attention on and don't get distracted then you will avoid
all these traps one at a time you will have
one big problem though which is that if you do
do this and you try to live a conscious life
then you will be labeled weird weird that dreaded word
that we dread ever since middle school in high school
you know weird we always wanted to be normal you
also always wanted to fit in well the bad news
is that you will be labeled weird because almost by
definition to live a conscious healthy lifestyle to find your
true self that's so rare in modern society that you're
not going to be mainstream anymore you will be weird
and you have to be okay with that you have
to be okay with not being mainstream not being normal
this is gonna take courage from you this is gonna
take independent thinking from you and this is gonna take
emotional labor from you so this lifestyle that I'm selling
you this higher consciousness healthy authentic lives now this is
the harder option there is no magic appeal to get
this you're gonna have to expend emotional labour to get
it and it means that you can't follow the path
of least resistance anymore because the path of least resistance
is where it's where businesses lay all the traps you
get this it's like when the deer the the deer
trail that's leading down to the water that's where the
trapper places all the traps because he knows the deer
is lazy he's gonna walk down the path he's not
gonna walk through the woods he's gonna walk down a
little path where all the deer walk and that's where
the trap will get him and that's exactly your situation
to start to get out of this you have to
sort of recognize just how unhealthy mainstream culture is mainstream
everything is incredibly unhealthy mainstream food mainstream entertainment mainstream media
mainstream news mainstream shopping and everything else it's unhealthy physically
for you it's unhealthy emotionally for you it's unhealthy financially
for you and it's very unhealthy spiritually for you and
you know actualize that already is not immune to this
actualize that always a business I'm here on YouTube chances
are you found my videos through YouTube if you did
you know I have to play the game to win
eyeballs to that's the game I have to play every
single day because if I don't play that game then
I can't run this channel in this company and put
this information out there so I have to learn how
to play this game and you know I've played this
game pretty good and I've played this game before I
started actualize that org I've played this game I've started
businesses and I know how it works so I'm kind
of talking as a bit of an insider here having
constructed many of these traps I know how to construct
traps for eyeballs this is not an evil conspiracy so
don't get me wrong you know I'm not saying here
that all these people are evil and there's a conspiracy
going on in society none of this trap what's really
going on here is just ignorance ignorance ego distraction that's
really going on all the CEOs and entrepreneurs in Silicon
Valley they're just neurotic ignorant people they're very wealthy they're
very wealthy and they might be very powerful and they
might feel like they're doing a lot of you know
good progress for society technologically and all this stuff but
really it's just ignorance and neuroses and some of them
wake up to that neurosis and then you know they
leave and they go off and they go find their
authentic selves but a lot of them don't a lot
of them they they stay neurotic until they have a
heart attack working 80 hours a week into their 60s
or 70s so you know it might seem like I'm
kind of ragging on capitalism here I'm not the the
fact is that you know there is a balance side
to this a lot of businesses do provide us good
services and some of this stuff is essential and in
the end you know we're living in a good time
I wouldn't want to trade our current time for any
other time in history it's a good time to be
alive right now because we have so much freedom you
have so many choices and also once you are aware
of all these traps you know what you can do
is you can use these traps and you can use
the tools and all these businesses create for you you
can use them kind of against them and you can
use them to find your authentic self faster because we
have all these great communication channels the internet all these
amazing resources books cheap stuff healthy food that's relatively cheap
so we have we have more opportunities than ever in
society so if you really wake up and you grab
the bull by the horns then you can make some
real class a quick progress so you might wonder at
this point what do I do Leo what do I
do about this well first of all like I said
relax don't go postal right this is not an evil
conspiracy you just need to wake up a little bit
you need to acknowledge that you're sucking on society's tit
and that you have been for years and that it's
time to wean yourself off and I want you to
make a commitment if you want make a commitment to
take your life back make a commitment to really live
an authentic lifestyle to stop the lies to stop the
distractions to stop being normal to live a different kind
of life the kind of life that your friends and
family are not living the kind of life that you
probably don't see anyone around you living that you have
no models or examples of unless maybe you watch some
of my videos that kind of life the kind of
life that you're scared to live the kind of life
that would require some bold moves that you're afraid to
make the kind of life that would require some renunciation
a renowned CA ssin of some of the stuff like
maybe porn or maybe video games or maybe smoking pot
or maybe watching sports or politics or something like you
know you have to renounce some of these things so
that you can make room for personal growth finding yourself
health and when I talk about health I don't just
mean physical health I mean even more importantly psychological health
which is what actualize that were just kind of committed
to is helping you to grow yourself psychologically so here's
a recommendation I want to make for you if you
want a practical step over the next six months if
you make a commitment right now to take your life
back then the big action step you can take over
the next six months is to take one week off
plan for I take a whole week off where you're
gonna go off and you're gonna be somewhere alone all
by yourself go rent a motel room on the edge
of town in the woods somewhere where you're just gonna
be all by yourself no friends no family no spouses
no one bothering you no cell phone no media no
internet no telephone no work no email no shopping no
fun no entertainment no television none of that stuff and
what you gonna do is you're just gonna sit there
for a whole week you're just gonna sit there in
that room maybe you want to go out into nature
go out into the forest or something and just sit
there for a whole week and just contemplate life think
about your life think about how sure it is how
precious it is how little time you have left think
about the fact they're gonna be dead soon don't eat
too heavy while you're doing this so that you aren't
falling asleep you know you want to stay alert and
just sit there and contemplate all this stuff maybe if
you're into meditation sit there and meditate and just detox
pull yourself out of all the caffeine the whole you
know hustle and bustle that you're doing your whole nine-to-five
routine pull yourself out of all that this is necessary
this creates space for your mind to get in touch
with being you're pulling yourself out of doing to get
into being and then just sit there and notice how
you feel and notice you know what your mind is
coming up with once you detox for the first few
days then throughout the rest of the week you're just
gonna be sitting there and have new ideas you're gonna
rethink some stuff in your life you're probably gonna want
to make some changes probably some habits you're gonna want
to install some healthy ones they're probably some bad ones
you're gonna what to cut maybe some big life choices
you're gonna want to make maybe there's a relationship you're
gonna want to end or maybe there's a a business
you're gonna want to end or maybe there's a career
gonna want to change or someone you're gonna want to
kick out of your life or whatever but just sit
there and just be and see what you're being reveals
to you take it slow take it easy it's gonna
feel weird at first it's gonna feel Restless because you're
gonna be having withdrawal symptoms from all this stuff you're
addicted to you are addicted to it trust me you'll
see when you sit there for a whole week you
are addicted to it and that's it and then see
where that takes you that could be the launching point
for a whole new trajectory in life for you this
could be the difference between living a life full of
regrets the normal life or the life where you start
really to take your self-actualization seriously and discover your true
self could be that big of a difference to you
so that's what I recommend but you know what if
you have some other idea and you want to make
this commitment to take your life back and you have
some other action step you want to do instead of
taking this whole week off go implement you know there's
a lot of different ways that you can implement this
stuff I'm just giving you one idea here so that's
it all right that's all I have to say I'm
signing off go ahead please click the like button for
me share this video with a friend post your comments
down below and lastly come check out actual eyes that
are right here it's my website I have a newsletter
it's free most of the videos I release are free
and they're very deep jam-packed with information that I spent
hundreds of hours of my time discovering and distilling and
taking notes on because I'm really really serious about this
idea of finding my authentic self and first and foremost
I do it for me I don't just do it
as a business I don't just do it to get
eyeballs you know I really do it for me because
this is me living my authentic life and the ideas
I share with you are ideas that help keep you
on track with living an authentic life of discovering who
you really are and finding the true fulfillment in life
that you're lacking right now you know also success I
don't really hate success if this is a good thing
you want a bit of that too so it'll help
you with getting success as well the trick here is
that it's very easy to fall back into your old
patterns it's very easy to go back to sucking on
society's tit even if you wean yourself for a few
months chances are you gonna come back so the key
functions matter lies I don't get to keep you on
track with your new self actualized life so stick around
watch the new content every week do they actually take
the action steps that I tell you to take don't
just sit there and do a mental circle jerk over
this theoretical material all the stuff that I talked about
is practical it's all actionable so take action and what
you're gonna see I promise you this is that if
you act on all the concepts that I share with
you that over the span of five to ten years
you will completely transform your life and your life will
be a hundred times more profound and gratifying that it
is right now and you will achieve levels of development
that you thought were impossible I'm not kidding that's my
promise I stand by it will happen if you just
take action so I hope you like that idea if
you do stick around watch the episodes and I'll see
you real soon with more you
