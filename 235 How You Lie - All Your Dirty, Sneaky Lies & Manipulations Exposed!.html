            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/XulpS3cAkOM' target='_blank'>How You Lie - All Your Dirty, Sneaky Lies & Manipulations Exposed!</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Deceptive Nature of Individuals</b>: Leo argues that individuals are fundamentally secretive, manipulative, and dishonest. He emphasizes that this deception is mainly self-inflicted and the main reason behind poor results in different areas of life, resisting personal growth. 
</li><li><b>Concept of "Self-Agenda"</b>: Leo introduces a concept called "self-agenda", which is a person's inherent desire for self-preservation and wellbeing. This preservation is more about maintaining an individual's perceived self-image rather than their well-being or health. 
</li><li><b>Truth vs. Self-Survival</b>: He emphasizes that truth is not a principle most people base their life decisions on, but self-survival, prioritizing comfort, and certainty. He claims any action or behaviour is in pursuit of these two states.
</li><li><b>Self-Honesty and Motivations</b>: When it comes to their motivations, people often convince themselves they act out of love, altruism, or societal improvement. However, Leon argues, upon honest introspection, it becomes apparent that they are driven by self-agenda and self-protection. 
</li><li><b>Low Awareness Contributes to Self-Agenda</b>: Low awareness or consciousness is common and is used as a defense mechanism to avoid the painful truth about self-deception and manipulation. Leo suggests raising awareness would involve facing these painful truths and challenging our self-concept, which is a difficult process. 
</li><li><b>Painful Consequences of Higher Awareness</b>: Higher awareness brings personal responsibility and also forces us to confront the lies we've lived our lives by &mdash; a process which Leo admits, is painful. This path to self-awareness ultimately leads to the dying of the old self or self-image.
</li><li><b>Hiding Lies From Oneself</b>: Leo argues that the most efficient way to hide a lie is the mind's act of self-deception, i.e., hiding the lie from itself. He presents the idea that the human mind is wired for self-deception because the 'self' as we perceive it is fundamentally a lie. 
</li><li><b>Limitations of Self-Awareness</b>: Ultimately, Leo suggests that complete self-awareness cannot coexist with the preservation of our old self-image. All aspects of personal identity and beliefs are fabrications of the mind, and sustaining these beliefs requires maintaining a state of low consciousness.
</li><li><b>The Human Mind and Self-deception</b>: Leo Gura proposes that the human mind is naturally geared towards self-deception as a survival mechanism. The self, as a concept, is viewed as a fabrication or a lie. This concept is based on the idea that the human mind is designed to serve a self-agenda without being conscious of it. 
</li><li><b>Survival and Reproduction vs Truth</b>: There is an ongoing conflict between the instinct of survival and reproduction, which demands self-centeredness and self-preservation, versus upholding truth. Gura argues that in many situations, humans prioritize their survival and reproduction over the truth. 
</li><li><b>Lying to Ourselves</b>: According to Gura, people often deceive themselves into thinking they value truth above all else. However, he suggests that this is usually just a lie or a self-image that we project to make ourselves feel noble. In reality, most people primarily serve their self-agenda to reproduce and survive.
</li><li><b>Lying as Cause of Problems</b>: Gura provides a list of problems caused or worsened by lying. These range from stress, anger, anxiety to health conditions such as back pain, skin rashes, depression, and heart attacks. The act of lying is considered to backfire and have negative consequences.
</li><li><b>Subtle and Unconscious Lying</b>: Most lying is subtle, unconscious, and not obvious. Gura suggests that the most effective liars are often not aware they are lying. This low consciousness facilitates harmful behaviors and manipulations without us realizing it.
</li><li><b>Hypocrisy and Self-Deception</b>: Gura advises viewers to be more mindful of their own hypocrisy, lies, and manipulations. He suggests that the solution is telling and honoring the truth, even when it's hard or costs us personally. 
</li><li><b>Three Levels of Truth-Telling</b>: Gura proposes three levels of truth-telling. At the first level, people must be honest with themselves about their thoughts, beliefs, and actions. At the second level, people must communicate facts honestly, even if it leads to negative consequences. The third level of truth-telling involves expressing one's emotions and feelings related to the situation.
</li><li><b>Lying and its forms</b>: Lying does not only involve verbal dishonesty or interactions with others, but can also include internal self-deceptions like being fake polite or eager to please for self-interest, acting cool or stoic to appear unaffected by bad news, indirectly asking for things one desires, labelling others as evil, expressing anger as a form of hurt, playing dumb, and withholding crucial information. 
</li><li><b>Selfishness behind false personas</b>: Pretending to be compassionate, selfless, spiritual, and modest often hides deep-seated selfishness. People labeling themselves as spiritual, loving, or altruistic can be highly deceptive and hypocritical.
</li><li><b>Moral judgments as lies</b>: People use moralizing, through 'shoulds' and falsified expectations, as a form of deception. Making judgmental statements about oneself or others often masks the truth.
</li><li><b>Lying in intimate relationships</b>: In intimate relationships, subtle manipulations and lies are often used to avoid conflict, manipulate partners, and fulfill selfish desires.
</li><li><b>Cultural deception</b>: Widespread cultural lies include deception about sexual behavior, deceitful practices in marketing and sales, withholding information in leadership positions, and presenting an artificially flawless facade.
</li><li><b>Not admitting mistakes and hiding insecurities</b>: To maintain a perfect image, people often refuse to admit mistakes and hide their weaknesses and insecurities. This false portrayal of perfection is a form of deceit.
</li><li><b>Withholding emotions</b>: The suppression of emotions contributes to self-deception. People often state they're "fine" to avoid sharing the truth about their feelings.
</li><li><b>Softening opinions and judgments</b>: People often soften their opinions and judgments, presenting watered-down versions of their thoughts to avoid conflicts or disagreements. This indirect form of expression is a deceptive practice.
</li><li><b>Underlying motives in communication</b>: Leo Gura discusses how individuals often tend to waterdown their true opinions, especially in formal settings, as an unconscious method of avoiding conflict. He states that we often convey a "soft, weak version" of what we truly think, in order to protect our self-image and maintain comfort.
</li><li><b>Manipulative humor and sarcasm</b>: Humor, sarcasm, and snarkiness are often used as manipulative tools, according to Leo. He explains that these can be used to belittle people, wage power wars, mislead, and divert attention from real issues. These are subtle, indirect methods of maintaining the self-agenda.
</li><li><b>Self-protection tactics</b>: Leo points out that individuals often secretly scheme to make sure they don't face negative consequences, citing the example of anticipated company layoffs. Here, the self-agenda manifests as efforts to protect oneself from getting fired by strategizing and planning potentially petty and unethical actions.
</li><li><b>Seeking validation</b>: The pursuit of approval, love, and validation, especially for people-pleasers, often involves manipulative actions. Leo criticizes this, referring to such behaviors as selling oneself out for validation.
</li><li><b>Concealing emotions and physical pain</b>: Leo points out that people often pretend not to feel hurt, physically or emotionally, in order to present a strong face to the world. This action is to preserve the self-image, and sometimes physical pain is even tolerated to maintain a certain perception.
</li><li><b>White lies and indirect expressions</b>: People often tell white lies, or express their emotions and desires in indirect ways to avoid direct confrontation or in an attempt at appearing humble. This, again, ties back to preserving the self-image and the self-agenda.
</li><li><b>Prevalence of hypocrisy</b>: Hypocrisy is often unnoticed by the perpetrators, with the biggest hypocrites usually being unaware of their hypocrisy. This form of self-deception is highlighted when people hold in their stomachs to appear slimmer, which Leo criticizes as a lie against one's true self.
</li><li><b>Solution - Honesty and truthfulness</b>: The solution to these issues, according to Leo, is becoming mindful of lying, manipulation, and self-deception and practicing honesty, especially when it is difficult and comes at a personal cost. He suggests three levels of truth-telling: being honest with oneself about beliefs, ideas, behaviors, and manipulations; communicating facts accurately and honestly; and expressing one's emotions in an honest manner.
</li><li><b>Communication of truth</b>: Leo Gura explains that communicating truth, especially in difficult situations, is divided into three levels. Level one involves noticing and accepting your manipulations. Level two involves accurately and honestly reporting the facts of situations even if they might lead to negative consequences. Level three goes a step further and involves expressing your emotions about the facts.
</li><li><b>Emotional communication</b>: Emphasizing on level three, Gura explains the importance of expressing emotions in the context of difficult conversations. This means sharing with others not only what happened but also how it made you feel.
</li><li><b>Importance of truth-telling</b>: Gura conveys that telling the truth might be feared as it threatens one's self-image and incites dread about potential consequences. However, he argues that it allows for personal growth, reduces mental health issue symptoms, and improves the overall quality of life.
</li><li><b>Consequences of lying</b>: Leo insists that constantly lying doesn't only tarnish personal integrity but also negatively affects the quality of life, leading to depression, stress, heart-related issues, and more. Lying and manipulation taint the individual's life negatively.
</li><li><b>Integration and overcoming the fear of truth-telling</b>: Emphasizing the discomfort associated with truth-telling, Leo also highlights that most fears associated with the consequences of honesty are exaggerated. A disintegrated life is painful, but the costs of truth-telling are often overestimated and can actually lead to more appreciated and fulfilling life experiences when embraced.
</li><li><b>Practical exercises</b>: Gura provides practical steps for viewers including being mindful of their self-agenda, manipulations, and lies. He suggests wearing a colorful rubber band as a constant reminder to stay honest and avoid falling back into old patterns.
