Hey, this is Leo, for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to be talking about understanding awareness. This is
a very important, very foundational topic, if you care about
self actualizing. Just as a quick side note, I'm changing
up the video settings again, trying to improve the video
quality, the lighting quality, the microphone quality, so you might
notice some of that stuff changing in the next couple
of weeks. But let's get to our main topic, which
is awareness. Speaking of noticing things, man, this is such
an important topic, I've actually thought about shooting this episode
right here and talking about this topic for over a
year. And the reason I've held back is because if
I don't communicate this information right now, in just the
right way, it will not get through to you, it
will just go in one ear and come out the
other and you're gonna fall right back asleep. So I
have to be very careful about the words I choose
and how I present all this stuff because your brain
will just shut me down. The first thing I want
to tell you is that right now you have no
idea how important awareness is. No matter how important you
think it is, it's woefully underestimated. In your mind, even
after watching this episode right here, you will only appreciate
understand perhaps 1% of the importance of awareness that it
plays in your life, in your fulfilment levels, in your
understanding of reality, and in your ability to be successful.
And in your ability to self actualize. It's that important.
It's incredibly important. And my goal here, pretty much the
sole role of this episode is to just show you
and convince you of how little awareness you have, how
much more you could have, and how you deceive yourself
about your lack of awareness. The reason it's so important
awareness is because all lasting growth of any kind, whether
you're growing in business or relationships, or your growing with
your emotions. It all involves increasing awareness in one form
or another. So I hope you can start to appreciate
how absolutely essential This is. And we have a big
challenge here we have several big challenges when we discuss
awareness. The first one is that this word awareness, you
know, awareness. This sounds like such a vague New Age
word. Sounds like something hippies were talking about you raising
consciousness raising awareness. But what does it really mean? And
see, because of this, your mind has a tendency to
easily dismiss these kinds of topics, or to just say
something like, oh, yeah, Leo already know that. I already
know that. You know, I read some Eckhart Tolle and
I read something about awareness. And I meditated a few
times I went on a retreat. I know what awareness
is. Be very careful about that. Because actually, you don't
know what awareness is. It's a very tricky thing. And
knowing what it is, is one thing, actually having it
is a totally different thing. What I want to start
to show you and I will with additional episodes future
episodes, is not just that awareness is very important. But
that awareness is actually a very tangible, very concrete thing.
It's not some new age, wishy washy language. It's very
important, but it takes some time for you to start
to, to like really see it and get it, because
it's not an easy topic to discuss. It's a very
soft, deceptive and tricky topic to discuss. In fact, this
leads us to challenge number two. The second challenge we
have with awareness is the catch 22 problem. What I
call it the catch 22. And it's this when you're
unaware, when you lack awareness, by definition, you're not aware
that you're not aware. You get that this is huge.
This is a huge point. Because this allows for a
giant self deception trap to happen in your mind. It's
like a huge blind spot in your entire worldview. Right
here. Because see, right now, your level of awareness is
probably at a one, maybe a two, maybe a three.
If you've done a lot of consciousness work, it's at
maybe a three on a scale of 10 million. On
a scale of 10 million, you're out a one, maybe
two, maybe a three. It's like you meditate, once in
a while, and you watch a bunch of my videos,
you're probably at a three at a 10 million. And
here's the problem. Not only this, but to you, it
doesn't feel like you're at a three, because of this
catch 22 problem, when you're unaware, you're not aware that
you're unaware. So what this means is that when you're
at a one, you feel like you're at 10 million.
When you add a two, it feels like you're at
10 million. And when you add a three, all man,
you feel like you're at 100 million, you're like, oh,
but look, I already progressed. So high up the up
the chain here, look how high I am, I'm not
a one or two, I'm a three, there's nothing higher.
And this is the catch 22 problem. And it leads
to the mother of all bad assumptions, which is the
assumption that you are aware, when in fact, you're not
aware at all. The mind tricks you into thinking that
you're aware. And the last problem I would say that
we have is that awareness cannot be taught. And it
cannot be bought. You cannot get awareness from reading books.
Or from buying it from somebody, or even from listening
to me. Or even by sitting there and doing philosophy,
or doing religion, that's not going to get you awareness.
So how do you actually get awareness was a little
tricky. We'll get to that perhaps. And I definitely will
cover that in future episodes. But for now, I just
want to focus on this idea of showing you how
asleep you actually are. Have you heard about people talking
about how you're in a dream state, you're asleep, you're
not awake? Well, that is your situation right now. And
I want to show you exactly tangibly what that really
means. I want to make you feel it in your
bones, it's one thing to know it intellectually is a
totally another thing, when you actually get a true sense
of like, Oh, my God, I am asleep. And to
do that, I'm gonna be talking mostly about one guy
here today. His name is Peter Uspensky. And he wrote
a brilliant little book called The psychology, the psychology of
man's possible evolution, he wrote this book nearly 100 years
ago, it's a really tiny book, look at it, it's
just a couple 100 pages really small, actually, less than
100 pages. Now, it's like 130 pages. And you don't
even need to read the whole thing, just the first
50 pages are sufficient to really get you a sense
and to open your mind to just how asleep you
really are. By the way, a little background on Uspensky.
Him and his buddy girge If they were really interested
in enlightenment, but this was 100 years ago, before the
internet before access to, you know many of the resources
we have today. And they were living in, in Europe
and in Russia. So it was really difficult for them
to get access to this kind of information. So they
basically went around the kind of like the Afghanistan, regions
of like Southern Russia, and like the northern Middle East,
looking for clues for how to get enlightened. And so
they had some interesting adventure adventures there. But what I
want to do is I want to, I want to
talk about some of the really important points that Uspensky
makes in this book. I read this book about three
or four years ago, when I started getting really seriously
involved in personal development work. And I was immediately struck
by the importance of this book, so intuitively understood that
yeah, I am asleep. And yes, there's these problems with
my not having enough awareness. But now, four years later,
after having done year, now a couple of years of
consciousness, really deep consciousness work, enlightenment work, meditating for the
last three years, every single day, going to lots of
workshops and talking to enlightened people, and, you know, doing
all this stuff really seriously. Even having an enlightenment experience
of my own last summer. Wow, I read this book
again this week, just to refresh my memory. And still,
I'm reading the book, and I'm still recognizing that I'm
asleep. Is the so it took me four years, and
I still haven't really penetrated to the depth of what
he's talking about here. I'm just scratching the surface. So
I'm saying this just to stress this idea that there's
something very important here that you're probably missing. You want
to be very careful about how you listen to what
I'm gonna be telling you. You want to listen very
open mindedly because otherwise you're going to easily miss Sit.
So the first thing I want to do is I
want to give you an outline of some of the
key points that Uspensky covers in this book. I'll give
you a kind of a big picture what we're talking
about here. And then what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna actually quote you some long excerpts from him and
give you some analysis about these excerpts. Because man, he's
extremely eloquent in the way that he puts some of
these things. So let's begin with the outline of expensive
keys key points. First, he says that man, and by
man here, we also mean women, he kind of talks
the way they did 100 years ago, but he says,
Man assumes that he knows himself. And of course, that
means you, we're all talking about you here, we're not
talking about some other man or some other woman, we're
talking about you. So you assume that you know yourself.
But man doesn't realize that he is the machine. What
does this mean that man has a machine? Well, man
assumes that he has will, and he has control over
his life. And in fact, he does not. Man is
unwilling to admit this to himself. And because of this
lack of willingness to admit it to yourself, he cannot
begin to correct this problem. Developing awareness takes long and
hard work. And the problem is that you will not
do this work if you believe that you have already
acquired self control and awareness. So why would you go
looking for awareness, and spending years trying to develop it,
if you already feel like you have it? This is
a very important point. And I'm just giving you kind
of a summary here. But I'm going to go into
a lot of depth on each one of these points
that he makes. Next, he also says that you really
need to appreciate how deeply asleep you are, before you
will take up the quest for raising your awareness until
this simply won't happen. And the whole trickier, he says
is that because in your current state, you're asleep. And
you don't have awareness, you cannot possibly even imagine how
much more awareness it's possible for you. You can't even
imagine I can't even begin to imagine what kind of
states of consciousness exist not just a couple of notches
higher orders of magnitude higher. This will blow you away
when you actually experience one of these higher states of
consciousness, because it will be orders of magnitude higher, beyond
anything you could have possibly imagined. I've experienced this. It's
quite remarkable. He also says, and I love this, as
he gives us a definition of what psychology is, He
gives us a three part definition, three ways to think
of psychology as very counterintuitive and different the way he
defined psychology than the way that regular psychologists do. First,
he said that psychology is the study of man's possible
evolution. What does this mean? This means that psychology is
not about dysfunctions. It's not about diseases or disorders of
the mind. It's about the highest of what a man
can become. And not just success wise, and not in
relationships. But how high can he develop his awareness and
his consciousness? what's actually possible for man, if he says,
Okay, I'm going to commit my whole life to just
developing awareness, how far can I go with it? That's
the proper domain of study for psychology. Notice that that
is not what most psychologists study. That is not what
most self help material teaches or talks about. Some of
it does, but most of it doesn't. Most of it
talks about success and relationships and stuff like this, or
depression and problems you have in your life, these kinds
of petty little human problems. What he's talking about here
is not human problems. He's talking about existential questions. So
it's kind of like the intersection between psychology and philosophy.
And philosophy actually talks about these is a philosophy in
the old school times 1000s of years ago, not modern
day bullshit academics like philosophy, but old school like the
Greek and Roman antiquity style philosophy. That was actually psychology
because it was concerned with conscious evolution and awareness and
existential questions. Secondly, he says that psychology can be divided
as follows. It's the study of oneself. So specifically, of
your machine like nature, the study of your machine like
nature. And thirdly says psychology can be defined as the
study of lying. I love this one. Sounds really interesting,
the study of lying, what does that have to do
with psychology? Seems like, even if that's a field of
psychology, that's like a very small, esoteric, little piece of
it. Why would it be mentioned here? Actually, it turns
out that lying is extremely central to the study of
psychology. Because lack of awareness comes from lying, and lying
about the fact that you lie, and your lies are
so subtle. And so in the dark, that you have
no idea how much you lie, and how this affects
your life. And we'll cover that in more depth as
we go forward. He really stresses it is very difficult
to convince to convince a man that he doesn't already
possess self consciousness. So if I come to you to
say, Hey, you're self conscious, right? And you say, of
course, and I say, No, you're actually not self conscious.
And you say, What do you mean, Leo? I am.
I mean, you're talking to me right now. And I'm
conscious, I'm self conscious look, here I am. I'm very
conscious right now. And that's a really big trick that
your mind plays on you. Makes you think that you're
conscious, but you're actually not. And in fact, Uspensky gives
us a self consciousness test. And I want to do
this with you, it only takes about a minute. Make
sure you actually do it. Because it's important that you
do this. So that you actually get some conscious traction,
so that you can see that you're asleep. Here's what
I'd like you to do. You can either do this
with me. Or ideally, if you have a clock or
a watch with a second hand that actually moves, go
get one of those clocks or watches. You can pause
this recording, go grab it, right now, if you've got
it. Good. If you don't have it, I have one
in front of me here, which I'm going to use
and I'll help you. Basically, the idea is this, you're
going to sit there and you're gonna look at this
second hand sweeping across the face of the watch for
one minute. And as you do that, you're going to
try to stay self conscious. So if I was doing
this, in my mind, I would say something. Okay, here
I am. I am Leo. I'm here. I'm conscious. I'm
Leo, this is Leo. And you just got to kind
of maintain that, that train of thought that this is
Leo, use your name that he's mine. And just sit
there and kind of be conscious of yourself for 60
seconds straight. Right, that's the test. So we're gonna go
ahead and do it. Right, I'm gonna do it with
you so Ready begin. And we're done. That was 60
seconds. So what did you notice there? You might tell
yourself that okay, I was able to stay self conscious
for 60 seconds. Actually, if you look much closer at
what happened, you were not able to do it. You
weren't able to do it, because your mind was wandering
all over the place. And you could actually notice when
your mind wandered off your self consciousness and wandered off
into some fantasy about dinner, or tomorrow's party or going
into work or answering an email or something like this.
And furthermore, if you're still believing that you're self conscious
here, and you say, Well, no, no, I was able
to say subconscious for all 60 seconds. So I don't
know what this test reveals. Pay attention to this, look
at this. Be before I had to do the test,
before you even turned on this episode and started watching
and listening to it. You were running unconsciously through life.
You were not actually self conscious. What happens is that
your mind plays a trick on you. It has a
memory and a thought in it says, Oh, well, no,
I was self conscious this whole, you know, this whole
day I was subconscious. What are you talking about Leo?
But see, that's just a memory. You weren't actually conscious
in the moment for most of your day. And in
fact, right now, the trick your mind is playing on
you is that it's saying but no, no, no, I'm
conscious right now. But see, the only reason you're conscious
right now is because I'm making you conscious, I'm talking
to you about consciousness. What is that that's actually me
triggering you, you didn't create yourself consciousness, I created it
in you. Your computer created an interview, you're sitting there
watching pixels on a screen, listening to some sounds coming
out of a speaker. And now you say you're self
conscious. Yeah, you're self conscious now. But when you turn
off this recording, and you go about your day, how
quickly you will you lose self consciousness very, very quickly.
So that's just beginning to start to make the point
that Uspensky is trying to make. The other point that
he makes is he says that the only means of
study. Because psychology is the study of oneself, the only
means of study is self observation. That's how you study
yourself. And the problem with this is that no one
can do it for you. No one can create awareness
for you really, I mean, I kind of triggered a
little bit for you. And you can get a little
hits of higher awareness by listening to spiritual teachers, and
you know, people who talk about awareness and wise things.
So it does help to read books and to listen
to these kinds of videos and so forth. But generally,
you have to do the hard, heavy lifting. The amount
of awareness that I triggered in you right now is
is minuscule. insignificant compared to the amount of awareness you
need to build within yourself. If you really want to
self actualize, and restructure your life to work well for
you. All that heavy lifting will have to be done
by yourself. It requires extraordinary responsibility, you have to take
all responsibility for it. And there's no shortcuts, there's no
magic tricks, drugs are not going to do it. Marijuana
is not going to do it. Mushrooms are not going
to do it for you, LSD is not going to
do it for you. This is heavy lifting you have
to do. It's emotionally difficult work. On top of all
that. And lastly, you Uspensky says that there are four
main features of your mechanical illness. One is lying to
his imagination. Three is talking. You're always talking. Four is
negative emotions. And I'll throw in two more that I
think are very important that I've discovered myself, which is
distraction, you're always distracting yourself. And the sixth one is
criticism and judgment. You're constantly mechanically criticizing and judging other
people. And this you're doing and holding yourself back from
increasing your awareness. So these are all the different ways
in which you act like a machine. You lie mechanically,
unconsciously. You use your imagination to go into fantasy mode
into stories about who did you wrong and what you're
going to do tomorrow and all this kind of stuff.
That's all your imagination at work. And this robs you
of your consciousness. Also, you're talking all the time, instead
of being aware, instead of trying to do careful, honest,
self observation, what you're doing is you're yapping, you're talking
to your friends to this, to this to that you're
writing little stupid comments. You're always making little criticisms and
judgments and all this kind of stuff through your talk.
And you're not comfortable just being silent. You can't even
sit face to face with someone and look them in
the eye and not talk to them. It freaks you
out. You're afraid of silence. That's not an accident, there's
actually a really good reason for that. And the negative
emotions, your negative emotions completely lose you in unconsciousness. Because
when you're feeling angry or afraid, or sad or depressed,
or any of this kind of stuff, you completely go
mechanical, you have no more control over yourself, you're just
running on autopilot. And of course, he gets into a
lot of trouble. Distractions distractions are huge. You distract yourself
with your entire life. Everything in your life is a
distraction from a developing awareness, your career, your family, your
children, your education, your work, your fitness routine, the food
you eat, the entertainment, you watch, the parties, you go
to the, the purchases you make, the alcohol you consume.
All of this stuff is just a complete distraction. It's
all mechanical distraction. And you're not even aware that you're
doing this. You think this is just normal life happening.
It's not normal life happening. This is a artifice, this
is artifice of modern society. modern societies I've said before,
is an amusement park for the ego. And what that
means is, it's an amusement park of illusions. It's like
a big hall of mirrors where you get lost. And
then you stumble around in it for years and decades
until you're dead. And then your criticism and judgment. So
I've, I've shot episodes where I talk about the importance
of watching out for yourself judgments, and your judgments of
other people. Because when you're criticizing or judging somebody else,
what this does is it takes all burden off of
you to look inside yourself. You see this fundamentally, what
you're doing when you're judging people, is you're turning all
your focus and awareness outwards, rather than inwards? This is
why we have political debates and religious conflicts and people,
you know, pointing fingers at each other, you know, how
could those Muslims and you know, how could those Jews
and those Christians and you know, and those scientists and
those Republicans in those Democrats and and that Obama, and
you know, the and that bush and this person there,
and you know, and all these criticisms? Why don't think
this is happening? It's not an accident, this stuff happens.
All of it is just a big giant Sham. Yep,
yep, yep, yep, yep, while you're yapping, your life is
expiring, and you're not looking inward. That's what's really going
on there. Crazy stuff, when you start to see this,
and you become aware of this happening in your life,
it's crazy. It will shock the shit out of you.
Alright, so that was just the outline. That was the
big picture. Now what I want to do is I
want to give you some of these juicy excerpts that
I've got. I'm going to read you from spent skis
writing. And then I'm going to give you some analysis
interspersed with all these different quotes. These are really eloquent,
really subtle. So listen, close, and you'll probably want to
listen to them multiple times again, to really get all
the juice out of them. Here we go, since he
says, quote, why cannot all men develop and become different
beings? The answer is very simple, because they do not
want it because they do not know about it, and
will not understand without a long preparation, what it means,
even if they are told, in order to become a
different being man must want it very much and for
a very long time. A passing desire or a vague
desire based on dissatisfaction with external circumstances will not create
a sufficient impulse. The Evolution of Man depends on his
understanding of what he may get, and what he must
give for it isn't man does not want it, or
if he does not want it strongly enough, and doesn't
make the necessary efforts and he will never develop. Man
must acquire qualities which he thinks he possesses. But what
she actually deceives himself about and quote, so he started
to talk about this problem. Why are not more people
more self developed? Well, the reason is, is that they
already believes they have what they're after. They already think
that they've got it handled, they've already got it figured
out. And they're not willing to invest the time in
when they're told what it's going to require to invest
this time, you know, I'm always up here preaching self
actualization. I always say, you know, stick around, stay tuned,
watch more episodes, it's going to build your awareness over
time over the years. Most people can't stay on track
with that. Because they don't see what the potential is.
And therefore, they're not willing to invest the time. And
they know people complain and say, well, Leo, why are
your videos so long? Make them half as long make
them 10 minutes long. See what that kind of attitude
how far can you get? I'm already paring down this
information very, very much to get it into even just
a 45 minute or 60 minutes segment. And you're going
to need hundreds of these segments to really struggle to
understand what's going on. And even hundreds of my episodes
will just be the, just the starting point of your
journey into increasing your awareness. So you can start to
see that this is a really serious endeavor. Now the
question is will take Well, surely, Oh, does it really
worth it? I mean, do we really need to do
this? Why don't I just kind of like live normal?
Like my friends? Do? You know, they don't do all
this crazy stuff. They don't invest all this time. What's
the point? Well, the point is, what you can get.
And I assure you that what you can get by
investing this time, is going to be worth orders of
magnitude more than what you paid for it. And, you
know, if you've watched my other episodes, I can I
show you little examples little and give you little glimpses
of kind of what's possible. Alright, let's keep going. He
says, quote, Man does not know himself. He does not
know his own limitations and his own possibilities. He does
not even know to how great an extent he does
not know himself. Man has invented many machines. And he
knows that a complicated machine needs sometimes years of careful
study before one can use it or control it. But
he does not apply this knowledge to himself. Although he
himself is a much more complicated machine than any machine
he has invented. He has all sorts of wrong ideas
about himself. First of all, that he does not realize
that he is actually a machine. What does it mean?
What does it mean that man is a machine it
means that he has no independent movements, inside or outside
of himself. He is a machine which is brought into
motion by external influences and external impacts. We must understand
that man can do nothing. But he does not realize
this and ascribe to himself the capacity to do this
is the first wrong thing that man ascribes to himself.
And quote, okay, wow. So that's a big, juicy one
there. What do we make out of this idea that
man is a machine? This goes to this question of
freewill. And this question of control. This is what the
ego fundamentally is about. The ego is an illusion inside
of you, the sense of self that you have, which
believes that it has control over your body, and your
mind and your thoughts and your life. You really believe
you have control that you're actually doing stuff, that you're
actually making important decisions, that you're actually moving your body,
that you're responsible for these things, that you're thinking, your
thoughts, that you're being creative, that you're going to work
and, you know, making big contributions to the world and
et cetera, et cetera. I hate to burst your bubble,
but this is actually not true. What Uspensky means by
man as a machine, is that he means that you're
completely at the effect of life. Life runs you, it
triggers you, when you have higher sense states of awareness.
It's because someone triggered you into them or something did.
When you're feeling sad, it's because something triggered you into
it. When you're feeling happy. It's because something triggered you
into it like you earn a lot of money. When
you're feeling in love, you can create love. The love
was triggered in you because you had sex with some
hot girl or some amazing guy. This is a really
difficult bullet to bite. Really, really difficult. I struggle with
this a lot, really a lot. But as you do
more consciousness work and you do some looking into enlightenment,
what you discover is that there cannot be there cannot
possibly be a self that is controlling all these things.
And this is why you struggle so much. This is
why you struggle for control so much. A really easy
test, if you want to test for how this is
true, is just sit down and try to stop your
thoughts for five minutes. Can you shut off your thoughts
for five minutes? Hell, can you do it for 20
seconds, you can't even do it for 20 seconds. It's
amazing. You can't because you actually don't have any control
over your thoughts. Your thoughts simply appear. In fact, what
you are is you are a thought you're one of
those thoughts that appears that's what self consciousness is. It's
a it's an appearing thought, which then disappears. Pretty 3d
thing, really difficult to buy into, because we're taught by
society that we do have control. And it feels like
we have control. There's certainly an illusion of control. It's
a very strong illusion, it feels like I'm doing, you
know, I'm standing up here, I'm talking to you. I'm
doing this I'm creating all these cool ideas that I'm
talking about. No, I'm not what I realized, now I'm
at my level of awareness, and it's still very low.
I'm not saying I have high awareness, not at all.
My current level of awareness, you know, when I'm talking,
I can, I'm aware that I'm not actually responsible for
the words that are coming out of my mouth, the
words are just coming out automatically. I have no idea
even what the next word is going to be. These
words are thoughts, I'm not thinking these thoughts, I'm not
responsible for these thoughts. This is a cool thing to
start to realize start to surrender yourself to, it's actually
extremely necessary. Because one of the problems you have in
life is that you're, you're neurotic, and you're anxious all
the time, and you can't turn off your monkey mind.
And your monkey mind gets only worse. When you believe
you can turn it off. You actually have no control
over that monkey mind of yours. That's why it's a
monkey mind. And the only way you're going to tame
that monkey mind, very paradoxically, is by realizing that you
have no control over it. That actually quiets it down
a bit. But we're getting into kind of, you know,
very deep territory here, which I'll cover another episode. So
let's keep going. Man, I got to talk a lot
in this episode, my throat is kind of dry and
still sore. So I got to make sure I can
last through all this talking. Okay, moving on. Uspensky says
man cannot move, think or speak of his own accord.
He is a marionette pulled here and there by invisible
strings. BE UNDERSTOOD understands this, he can learn more about
himself. And possibly then things may begin to change for
him. But if he cannot realize this, and he could
not understand his other mechanical illness, if he does not
wish to accept it as a fact, he can learn
nothing more, and things cannot change for him. Man is
a machine but a very peculiar machine. He has a
machine which in the right circumstances with the right treatment
can know that it is a machine. And having fully
realized this, he may find ways to cease to be
a machine and quote. So what does this mean? Well,
we're continuing on with this theme that I've been talking
about you are a machine that does not have control
of itself. You were born to this world without an
instruction manual. And you're an extremely complex machine. And we
just kind of assume that, hey, we don't even need
an instruction manual. We'll just kind of wing it. fly
by the seat of our pants. Man does this get
us into trouble really gets into trouble. At some point
I'd like to sit down and say wait a minute.
Maybe I need to figure out and construct my own
manual for how this machine works. If I actually observe
the inner functioning, mechanical nature of myself, my mind how
I think how I react emotionally to situations, how I
judge people how I lie. If I start to investigate
all this, I can actually develop a working understanding of
this machine that I am and as I do that,
I noticed that my life goes better. It's much smoother,
there's a lot less suffering, there's a lot less pain,
a lot more peace of mind. I have more emotional
control. I have more ability to take care of myself
and to live in this world to be successful in
the right ways. I can shed many of my neuroses
as I do this. But see, to do that, because
this is a long term project that requires serious investment
of effort and time and emotional labor. I have to
realize that admit, first that I am a machine that
I am mechanical. That I don't have the control that
I believe I have. I can't stop my thoughts. I
can't control my depression. I can't control my anger. I
can't control my judgments. I can't control my obsessive compulsive
behaviors. I can't control my food addictions. I can't control
my bad habits. If I could control these things, how
come they're so difficult to change? How come my life
is so screwed up? How come I can't quit smoking,
or drinking or partying? Or having sex with the wrong
people, or screwing up and sabotaging my own relationships? How
can I struggle with money? How can I struggle to
to get along with my children or my family members?
How can I keep getting divorces? How can I keep
judging people even though I know I shouldn't? How come
I'm a perfectionist? How come? I'm a workaholic? How come
I can't lose the 20 pounds of extra fat around
my waist? Well, maybe it's because you're a machine. And
you lost control of the mechanism. In fact, you never
had control the mechanism. You only think you did. And
you never really learned what this human machine is and
how it functions. Because no one taught it to you.
Because the people you grew up with, they did exactly
the same thing that you did is they said, Oh,
I know everything. I know, I know how to live
life, I'm just going to go and wing it. And
they winged it. And then they taught you those same
strategies. They didn't invest decades of careful self observational study,
and all the emotional pain and labor that goes into
really raising their awareness. So they were unaware, and they
taught you unawareness. And that's what happened to you, machines
created machines. Let's go on with first he says quote,
before man can acquire any new powers and capacities, he
must actually develop in himself those qualities which he thinks
he possesses and about which he has the greatest possible
illusions. development cannot begin on the basis of lying to
oneself or deceiving oneself. Man must know what he has
and what he has not. It means that he must
realize that he does not possess the qualities already described,
which he ascribes to himself. That is the capacity to
do individuality, permanent ego or unity. And in addition, consciousness
and will. It is necessary for a man to know
this because as long as he believes that he possesses
these qualities, he will not make right efforts to acquire
them. Exactly as a man will not buy costly things
and pay a high price for them if he thinks
he already possesses them, and quote. So again, we're just
hammering on this point. That if you think you have
freewill, if you think you are conscious, if you think
that you are already aware of what your existential nature
is, if you think you are this human body that's
standing here talking to you, if you think that that's
you. If you think like you're this individual sitting there
if you think you really have control over your life
how are you going to do the work to actually
acquire those things because you don't actually have those things
you only believe you do? You're not going to pay
the price. And this is why people do not do
personal development, generally speaking. Because they assume they've already got
it figured out. Next to Spassky says quote, consciousness can
be made continuous and controllable by special efforts and special
study. With the right methods and the right efforts, man
can acquire control of consciousness and can become conscious of
himself with all that this implies what it implies we
are present state do not even begin to imagine. Only
after this point has been understood, the serious study of
psychology become possible. The study must begin with the investigation
of obstacles to consciousness in ourselves. Because the consciousness can
only begin to grow, when at least some of the
obstacles have been removed. We must understand now that psychology
really means self study. One cannot study psychology as one
studies astronomy, that is apart from oneself. And at the
same time, one must study oneself as one study is
any new and complicated machine, one must know the parts
of this machine, its chief functions, the conditions of right
work, and the causes of wrong work, and many other
things which are difficult to describe. And quote. So it's
really important that we start to study the obstacles to
awareness, the obstacles to consciousness, what are they, it's all
that stuff that we mentioned, it's the lying that you
do is the judging you do the distractions in your
life, the talking that you do, the criticism that you
do all of that stuff, the negative emotions that you
react to. The more you study that, the more the
doors open for you to really get on this path.
So one thing that actualised.org is doing, if you're watching
a lot of my content, is it's shining a little
bit of light, if you notice this a little bit
of light on some of these major obstacles that you
have in life, most people have your relationship here, your
business problem there, whatever. But ultimately, just shining light on
that so that you can finally get to this point
where you realize like, oh, oh, yeah, I see what's
going on here on the mental level, I'm having all
these problems because I don't have enough awareness. And as
soon as I raise my awareness in one of these
situations, my life starts to improve just a little bit.
But I still feel very, very last in my awareness
is still very inconsistent. Maybe I should get on board
and start to study myself on a metal level. Really
get into the guts of how I work how my
mind works. And then, you know, by that point, then
you will start to buy in to stuff like meditation,
and enlightenment work and some of these more kind of
New Age concepts about not having free will and not
having a self and all this kind of weird stuff.
You know, then you start to be open minded to
that. Until then, you're totally closed minded to it. Because
you're you're asleep. That's when the study of self begins.
That's when you really start to get into real psychology.
That's a huge turning point for you and your growth.
But also, you know, that's just the start. People think
that okay, now I'm now I'm really, you know, doing
something here. No, this was the start, you're on step
one out of 100,000. You're just getting started. Let's go
on, let me take a sip of water first. Okay.
Uspensky says, quote, all the absurdities and all the contradictions
of people and life in general, become explained when we
realize that people live in sleep, do everything in sleep,
and yet do not know that they are asleep. The
first obstacle in the way of development of self consciousness
and man is his conviction that he already possesses self
consciousness, or at any rate, that he can have it
anytime he likes. It's very difficult to persuade a man
that he is not conscious and cannot be conscious, it
will. It is particularly difficult, because here nature plays a
very funny trick on him. If you ask a man,
if he is conscious, or if you say to him
that he is not conscious, he will answer that he
is conscious, and that it is absurd to say that
he is not because he hears and understands you, and
he will be quite right at the same time quite
wrong. This is nature's trick. He will be right because
your question or remark has made him vaguely conscious for
a moment. The next moment consciousness will disappear. But he
will remember what you said and what he answered and
he will certainly consider unselfconscious and quote. So this is
exactly the catch 22 that I was referring to earlier.
And you notice, you're going to do exactly this. Right
now, as I'm talking to you about consciousness, you think
you're conscious? You're actually not. You're totally asleep right now.
Right now, even when you think you're most conscious, you're
still totally asleep. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine
if that was true? Would that be crazy? What could
be outside of this dream state? What if you're in
a dream state right now? What could be outside of
it? I'm not being figurative. I'm not being metaphorical. I'm
being literal. The state of consciousness that you're stuck in
right now is the equivalent of being asleep is the
same difference. So where you could be in your consciousness,
compared to where you are now is the same degree
of difference as where you are? When you're asleep in
bed at night? And where you are right now? That's
pretty crazy. It's pretty crazy to actually consider that's possible.
But what if it was possible? Either one, that'd be
pretty bad news. Because like, oh, shit, I'm asleep. You
mean, I'm asleep. But then on the other hand, it's
actually great news. Because like, well, that means that you
know, life is already pretty nice. Let's say for you.
It's like, well, so you mean, I could be that
much more conscious? Damn. That's cool. That's cool. That's a
whole new world of possibilities that I didn't know existed.
How do I get to that place? Where I have
to do I'll do it? Because it sure seems like
a significant thing. It doesn't seem like just a quantitative
improvement. It seems like a whole qualitative improvement, like a
vast difference. Right? There's a vast difference between being asleep
in bed and being awakened life. And there's a vast
difference between awakened life. And actually, let's say enlightened, but
we're not even going there yet. It's hard to believe
that this is possible. You have to have an intuition
for it. This was called wisdom. Spiritual wisdom. Give me
an intuition that this is possible. It starts with intuition.
You got to take it on faith. And then you're
going to do enough self investigation and self observation work
to finally get there. That will take you years though.
In the meantime, you need to have enough intuition to
see that this. There's a little kintu truth here sounds
kind of true. Sounds like it might be possible. Why
would Leo be up here talking about it? Why would
he develop an entire life purpose around it? Why would
he commit his whole life to it? Why would he
spend hundreds and 1000s of hours of his time developing
such videos? If it wasn't important? Is he just oh,
maybe he's just stupid. Oh, yeah, he's just some confused,
stupid New Age hippie, you know? Yeah, of course. Maybe
I'm a confused, New Age hippie. Or, maybe I'm onto
something and other people are onto something. And you could
be on to it to maybe. Let's go on. We
suppose he says quote, in reality, acquiring self consciousness means
long, hard work. How can a man agree to do
this work if he thinks he already possesses the very
thing which is promised to him as a result of
the long and hard work? Naturally, man will not begin
this work. And he will not consider it necessary until
he becomes convinced that he possesses neither self consciousness nor
all that is connected with it. And quote, as huge,
that's huge. If you can reach this tipping point that's
going to be the start of something really big for
you down the road. If you can reach this tipping
point, very few people will very few people less than
1% of 1% of 1% You may think you reach
this tipping point. But see what happens is you reach
it and then you fall back asleep. Like you're gonna
listen to me. You're gonna hear all this interesting stuff
and you're like, Yeah, Leon boy. Hold with you enlightenment
Fuck yeah, let's go. And then what happens tomorrow you
forget about it, you fall asleep, you just go back
to work, you go back to your family life, you
start worrying about the bills again, you're completely asleep. As
soon as you finish watching this episode, you're completely asleep
again. You could watch this episode 100 times, and you
will fall asleep 100 times. That's how deep this problem
is. That's why this whole episode is just me standing
up here for over an hour, trying to convince you
of how asleep you are. That's all I'm doing. That's
all I'm doing here. It's, it's a force of nature.
You're asleep. This is a force of nature, it's a
really powerful force. The image that I like to conjure,
in my mind for this latest metaphor that I have
is, imagine the middle of the Pacific Ocean is giant
ocean, you can't even see land to the horizon, because
you're in the middle of the ocean, just as vast
blue ocean that's stretches miles deep. And then imagine you
are now given a shovel. And you have to dig
a hole in this ocean to the very bottom, dig
a five meter wide hole, straight to the bottom of
the ocean with your shovel. That's pretty much the task
that we're up against here. Every scoop of water you
take just gets filled up with the rest of the
water, right, you can't win this battle, it's really hard
to win is a force of nature. And this is
what your lack of awareness is like. Alright, let's keep
going. He says quote, We cannot know the truth. But
we can pretend that we know. And this is lying.
Lying fills all our life. People pretend that they know
all sorts of things about God about the afterlife, about
the universe, about the origins of man about evolution, about
everything. But in reality, they don't know anything, even about
themselves. And every time they speak about something they do
not know, as though they knew it, they are lying.
Consequently, the study of lying becomes of first importance to
psychology. And it may even lead to the third definition
of psychology, which is this, the study of lying. Psychology
is particularly concerned with the lies man says and thinks
about himself. These lies make the study of man very
difficult. Because man as he is, is not a genuine
article. And quote I have an episode called how you
lie, where I go into quite a bit of length,
about all the specific and tangible ways in which you
lie. I remember when I first read this part of
the book was spent ski part of the book that
I just quoted you I first read it about four
years ago. And I kind of crinkled my nose, this
idea that I lie and that everybody lies like, Well,
man, this is such a negative view of the world
like everyone's a liar. It's not quite like that. What
he means by lying here is very different than you
probably think. It really is more like a form of
self deception. It's not like you're deliberately going out there
lying to people, although you do, of course, do plenty
of that. But it's more about the ways you deceive
yourself the subtle ways in which you lie, how you
lie about your emotions, how you manipulate with your lies,
how you say things that are half true, that aren't
genuine for you, in order to control your life a
little easier, a little better. And then of course, you're
not conscious of all these lies that you make, and
you're not conscious of how they affect the quality of
your life. You think that these lies are kind of
innocent, and they're just normal? Everyone does it. It's okay
Leo, don't be such a stick in the mud. You
know, I'm not going to be a saint. You want
too much. This is all silly. Let's just be practical
and realistic. But it's just more lies. Lies fundamentally come
from lack of awareness. So if we want to increase
our awareness, one of the first obstacles that we have
to tackle is this line that we do. And I
cover that in that episode called how you lie. You
might want to check that one out. It's pretty a
pretty important one, I think. Let's go on he also
says, quote, to know oneself. This was the first principle
in first demand of old psychological schools. We still remember
these words but have lost their meaning. We think To
get to know ourselves means to know our peculiarities or
desires or tastes, our capabilities and our intentions, when it
really means to know ourselves as machines, that is to
know the structures of one's machine, its parts, functions of
different parts, the conditions governing their work and so on.
We must study our own machine, as machines. The study
is called self observation. There is no other way and
no one can do this work for us, we must
do it ourselves. And quote to know thyself, this was
a supposedly written on the doorway to the Oracle at
Delphi, back in antiquity, in the Greek and Roman times
to know thyself. That's a very important principle of self
development is to know thyself. But what does that really
mean? There's a deeper level at which you need to
know yourself. And that's the level at which you deceive
yourself mechanically. What are all the specific ways in which
you go unconscious? What are all the specific ways in
which you lie, distract, judge and criticize, talk, yap away
blabber mouth. Or get lost in fantasy and imagination. Get
lost in your ego. Get lost in your negative emotions.
Get lost in your passions and in your desires. This
is the stuff of prime importance that you should be
studying. And of course, if you're a longtime follower of
actualize that org, then you know that this is kind
of all the stuff that I cover. I've been covering
this stuff for years now. Every episode gives you a
little tiny glimpse and insight here and insight there about
how you do one of these things in one way
or another. And I've only been just begun to cover
these things. I could shoot videos for the next 50
years. And I would still not cover all the stuff
that needs to be covered. There's that much stuff to
become aware of. Next, he says quote, slash observation observations
will very soon give results. Man will notice that he
cannot observe everything he finds in himself impartially. Some things
may please him, other things may annoy him or irritate
him or even horrify him. And it cannot be otherwise.
Man cannot study himself as a remote star or as
a curious fossil. And quote. This is a really important
point. We're doing self observation. Self observation. This is extra
tricky, because we have biases within ourselves. How do you
observe yourself objectively, it's really hard. It's kind of like
you're being asked to be the judge of your own
murder trial. And you're asked to find yourself guilty. And
you believed your the whole time that you're not guilty
until one day you discovered Holy shit. I actually did
murder that person. I just deceived myself into thinking that
I didn't. And that should horrifies you, you didn't think
that you were capable of that. That was part of
the self deception. See, here's a really important point. A
lot of academic people miss this a lot of rationalist
scientifically minded people miss this is they think that you
can just do science on human beings kind of like
you know, well, Leo, give me some lab studies. Let's
prove all this stuff with lab studies. You know, in
a very objective, academic institution, give me some Harvard studies,
some Stanford study this kind of stuff. Here's the problem
with other studies in the reason that I don't really
rely on studies very much. It doesn't get you awareness.
All the studies in the world will not get you
awareness of yourself. You need to study yourself. Not only
that, but these studies are studying outer behaviors of human
beings. They're not stuck they can't really get inside the
human being. So it's a it's a whole nother ballgame.
When you start to investigate yourself in general, modern science
is really good at you know, making airplanes and cell
phones and computers, all this kind of stuff. It's great
at that. That's all kind of the the external world
is terrible. God awful at studying the inside of the
human mind, mostly because it actually denies its existence. Science
as one of its paradigms and precepts, almost denies subjectivity.
Or if it doesn't deny it, it just completely ignores
it and says, You know what? subjectivity, that's just some
woowoo. fuzzy stuff, you know, touchy feely, emotional stuff, we
don't need to worry about that. Let's just focus on
you know, how to split the atom and make an
airplane and how to make a proton collider, something like
this. So modern science has really been behind the ball
on this one, it'll catch up, I think, but it
will take some time. So in the meantime, you know,
we have to do the work ourselves, all the heavy
lifting has to be done from the inside, no one
can observe you for you. And at the same time,
when you're doing self observation, you have to do it
objectively. Most people, when they go do self observation, they
try to investigate their beliefs or ideas. They completely get
lost in their own biases. Go take a religious person,
like a Christian, or a Muslim, or any other religious
person, and ask them to honestly investigate their own beliefs,
they flat out can't do it can't do it. It
doesn't even occur to them that their beliefs could have
been handed down to them. And the only reason they
believe a belief like God, or the Bible, or this
or Muhammad or whatever, is because it was just fed
to them when they were child like, that possibility doesn't
even enter into their minds, because they had to block
that off. Now those who are religious people, I can
also bring up scientific people and give you examples of
them doing exactly the same thing. You know, someone who's
at Harvard, who's a, you know, an award winning psychologist,
but has no actual control of his own psyche, has
no awareness is totally asleep. Even though he has all
these distinguished awards, and he's done all these studies, and
he could have won the Nobel Prize, but he has
no fucking idea about what what emotions are, what awareness
is, who he himself is. His life is a fucking
mess. He's neurotic, he drinks, he smokes, he's divorced, three
of his wives. He can't get along with his children.
And then he has all these fucking awards about how
great of a psychologist he is. It's preposterous. preposterous, because
all the logical understanding of the world will not get
you awareness. Very huge trap. In fact, in a sense,
you know, these, these rational, scientific minded people, I really
have a bone to pick with them, because I was
one of them for a long time, is because, you
know, they feel like they're superior to the religious people.
But in a sense, they've got their head up their
own ass so far, that it's almost worse. It's almost
worse than religion. I can excuse and forgive religious people.
Because usually, they're kind of like, you know, they're not
very sophisticated, don't really care about this stuff. They're not
really into like, learning and knowledge. It's just like, they're
just kind of like very ordinary people who, a lot
of times, you know, they just weren't given the benefits
of having, like a really good education or this or
that. So it's just kind of like, yeah, they fell
into it. It's kind of like a disease of the
mind. But with these fucking scientists, it's like, Good God,
you have a PhD, you've been going to university, you've
been reading books, you've been taught how to think. What
the fuck are you doing? pretty passionate about that point.
All right. So that's everything that I wanted to read
to you from Uspensky. What I want to do to
wrap this up is I want to do an exercise
to really drive home to you experientially, the staggering depth
of your unawareness. How asleep you really are. Because what
I've been talking about here is just all more intellectual
stuff. You know, it sounds nice, but really, it's not
gonna make you awake. You're gonna fall right back asleep
as soon as the video is over. So, do this
with me. Sit in your seat, get comfortable, back up
straight and close your eyes and I'm gonna guide you
to a really quick little meditation which will shine some
light on your lack of awareness. All right, good. Close
your eyes. Keep your eyes closed through until the end.
Just take a nice deep breath exhale slowly just the
darkness behind your eyes. eyes and just start to get
calm and into the present moment I'm going to guide
you through some through some various sensations that I'm going
to want you to put your attention on your awareness
on. Feel and become aware of the air on your
face right now as you're doing that, I want you
to also put your attention on the self image of
your face that you have. You can't actually see your
own face. But you paint a picture in your mind's
eye, you have a fantasy of your own face. In
fact, technically speaking, you've never actually seen your own face
in your entire life. You just have a fantasy of
it. So just become aware of that image of your
face. Now I'd like you to feel the touch of
your clothes on your body just put your attention on
it don't move your body and also, because your eyes
are still closed, I like you to also put your
attention on the fact that you have an image of
your body. This is a fictional fantasy image. It's not
real in the sense that it's actually your body. But
you think of it as your body just put your
awareness on that internal image now I would like you
to do is to feel the inside of your mouth.
Don't move your mouth don't move your tongue. But just
become aware that there are sensations in your mouth. They
feel kind of interesting. You your tongue, your gums, your
teeth, they have a certain weight to them they have
a certain feeling and texture good and now also become
aware that when you're feeling the inside of your mouth,
you also have an image of the inside of your
mouth. It almost feels like you can see inside your
mouth for a little bit. Of course you can't not
really it's just a fantasy but just become aware of
that image good now what I'd like you to do
is become aware and feel the temperature of your body
gotta interesting that your body has a temperature effect, maybe
there's different temperatures throughout your body just feel them good.
Now, I want you to put your awareness and to
feel the inside of your palms. Your hands the inside
of your hands. As you're doing that, notice that you
have a image again in your mind's eye of your
palms, and maybe even your hands and arms. Those aren't
really your hands and arms but you do have an
image of them because your eyes are still closed just
notice that now what I want you to do is
to feel and become aware of the skin on your
ears. So just feel your ears and as you do
that, I want you to become aware that you have
a self image, an image in your mind's eye again,
of your ears. And not just your ears but also
your head. It's almost as though you're looking down on
your head from behind through a camera. But notice that
this, again is the self image created in the mind,
it's a fantasy. That's not really your head. Also, now
I want you to notice, I want you to notice
the sound of your inner voice. Notice that inside your
mind, there is a voice that speaks to you. It's
not my voice, it's your voice. At least you call
it your voice. In fact, you probably think of it
as you. This is how you think you talk to
yourself. So just notice how much talking happened over the
last couple of minutes while your eyes were closed, doing
this exercise. And just become aware that there are the
sounds that this voice makes. It also makes images. So
you've been having mental images this whole time, I've been
making you aware of certain mental images you've been having.
But you've probably also been having some distracting ones, maybe
you've been thinking about lunch or dinner, or a bird
chirping outside, or the sun shining on you or something
like this. Just again, put your awareness on that. Good.
And we're done. So go ahead. And you can take
another nice deep breath in, to put yourself out of
that state. And go ahead and open your eyes and
come on back. Good, welcome back. So what happened there?
Did you notice that you started to notice and become
aware of things that you were never aware of before?
Did you notice that you were completely unaware of almost
everything I took you through all these different phases and
parts that I took you through, you were unaware of
almost all of these sensations, and images and sounds, until
I triggered them in you with this exercise. Right now,
as you're listening to me, you're listening to me, but
your attention and focus is split, you're not aware of
certain things like the temperature of your body, even right
now. Now, when I say it, of course, you can
become aware, because I trigger you. But then you know,
while you're feeling the temperature of your body, all of
a sudden, you're not aware of the feeling inside your
mouth. And if you're aware of that, then you're not
aware of the error on your face. And if you're
aware of that, then you're not aware of the skin
on your ears. And if you're aware of that, and
you're not aware of the image that you have of
your hands, in your mental kind of your mental movie
theater. And if you're aware of that, you're not aware
that you have an image of your head. And that's
not actually your head. You see what I'm getting at
here is like this, these, it's like holding sand in
your hands. That's what awareness is. It's like you're trying
to hold sand in your hands and then just kind
of slips through your fingers. And everything you do to
try to hold on to it, it just slips through
it more and more and more. This is what we're
up against here. It's really challenging. really challenging. So this
here was a little just taste a little tip of
the iceberg, don't think that this is where it ends.
This is where it only begins. There's so much more
that you're unaware of. It would take me hundreds of
hours to tell you all of it. And I will
with time. But for now, I just want you to
get the bottom line. This is all you need to
get is that you are asleep. That's all you got
to get. That's where it starts. If you can acknowledge
that if you can admit that if you have enough
self honesty and enough awareness to see this. That's a
really big step forward. It might seem like it's not
a big step, because you didn't take any action, you
really didn't do anything. You didn't earn a lot of
money here. You know, it might seem like it's not
very practical. It's super important, I promise you is super
important. Especially if you stick with me here and you
keep watching more of these episodes and keep going along
with this. The stuff we talked about here is incredibly
deep, and you will not have understood most of it.
That's okay. It will probably take you five or 10
years just to get to the point where you can
start to really understand what was being talked about here.
Five or 10 years of real serious work on your
awareness and on your consciousness. Seems like a lot seems
like a lot of effort. But you know what, if
you do it, it will transform your whole life. I
guarantee it, it will transform your entire life, how you
live your entire life, how you feel about your entire
life in a positive way, in a way, where you
would say, oh my god, Leo. That that one video
of yours I watched 10 years ago, and it really
clicked for me, that changed the whole trajectory of my
life, it changed the whole trajectory of my work of
my career, my relationships, of my health, of everything, of
how I relate to my children of what I teach
my children of where I live, of how I live,
of who I believe I am. But there's a trick.
And the trick is that for you to actually get
what I'm promising you, you need to not fall asleep,
as much as you usually do. You need to kind
of like stick around and keep waking yourself up, you
will fall asleep. So don't get me wrong, you will
fall asleep. But you know, you need to come back
and kind of like wake yourself up once in a
while, at least once in a while. Otherwise, you're just
gonna fall back asleep. And never, never remember any of
this stuff that I said ever again. So this is
where I'm ending it. I want you to stay tuned.
Stay tuned, because there's much more I got to tell
you about awareness. I need to tell you about what
awareness actually is. We can even talk about what it
is what it actually is. I also need to share
methods and techniques with you for how to raise your
awareness. How do you do that? That's a really long
and complicated topic. So you know, I'll break that down
into episodes and show you in the future. So stay
tuned for that. Hope you can see how important this
is. You know, I'm committed I pretty much my whole
life, to increasing my own awareness and to showing you
how to increase yours. That's what actualize. org is here
