hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we're going to talk about positive thinking okay so
let's talk about positive thinking I want to illustrate what
I have to say about positive thinking by telling you
a short story so this is a Zen story from
a long time ago and it goes like this once
there was an old village in this village there were
the villagers and there was one odd farmer who lived
on the outskirts of the village and he was a
little bit different the way he thought his philosophy to
life was just something that didn't quite sit well with
the rest of the villagers so one day this farmer
he had a horse and this horse went off and
ran away and that was just as he went out
and bought a new saddle for the horse so this
horse ran away and it took the saddle with it
now the villagers hearing of this news they went to
the farmers farm they went to his house and they
said we're so sorry what bad luck you have your
horse ran away and the farmer looked at them and
said maybe it's bad luck but who knows maybe it's
good luck and they looked at I'm kind of weird
and they said well how could it how could it
be good luck your horse your only horse ran away
what are you gonna do now he said well we
don't know maybe it's good luck maybe it's bad luck
the villagers left his house scratching their heads and they
went back to their business a few days later the
horse returns to the farmer and the horse brings with
it three wild horses so now the farmer has his
horse back with the saddle plus three new horses untamed
the villagers hearing on this news they make their way
to the farmers house and they said wow what amazing
luck you have and the farmer looked them and said
maybe it's good luck but maybe it's bad luck who
knows the villagers they looked at them puzzled how could
how could you possibly say this is bad luck you
had one horse then it ran away now you've got
that horse back plus you got three new ones this
is amazing the farmer looked at them and said maybe
it's good luck but maybe it's bad luck the villagers
left shaking their heads not sure what to think then
a few days passed and the farmer's son because he
had to tame and train these new three horses as
he was trying to train one of the horses one
of those wild horses it kicked him and it knocked
him down and he broke his leg over a rock
the rest of the villagers hearing of this news they
they made their way to the farmers house and they
said we're so sorry what terrible luck you've had the
farmer looks at them and says maybe it's terrible luck
but maybe it's good luck now this this the just
and this anymore how could you possibly say this is
good luck I mean your your only son broke his
leg surely this is the worst of luck farmer looks
at them considers their suggestions and says well maybe it's
bad luck but maybe it's good luck the villagers were
just aghast and they walk away angry and then a
few days later as his son is recuperating from his
broken leg he's lying on the bed there the country
officials come by through the village and they're conscripted troops
for the army for the war that's going to be
waged overseas and what they do is they round up
all the able-bodied young men in the village to go
off to die in battle but they don't take the
farmer son because the farmer son is not able to
walk so that's the story this is an old Zen
story and I have to give credit to John Kehoe
who I got this the story from and the way
that he delivered it it was really powerful for me
because what this story shows us is that who really
knows I mean who really knows what is good luck
and what is bad luck in our life the wiser
of us we see that it's not quite so simple
that the things that are unpleasant that happened to us
are necessarily that bad for us and the things that
are pleasant on the surface are necessarily good for us
that's a very simplistic way to think about life and
in the end you truly can't tell not until every
last card is played out what is good luck and
what is bad luck and when you start to really
understand this and you start to take this in a
very deep then you start to understand what it means
to be a positive thinker you can get a lot
of little tricks out there that will help you to
think positively to be more optimistic but I think if
you want to really cultivate positive thinking within yourself you
have to start to take on this idea that there's
something deeper going on in life and that it's not
quite so simple to figure out exactly what it is
if you think about all the really challenging they're really
hard times you've had in your own life all the
really unfortunate times the ones that we would obviously label
as unfortunate and then you trace back the ripple effects
from that through the rest of your life and into
the present you trace that back and you take a
look a lot of times what you find is you
find your greatest gifts there you find your greatest strengths
there you have you find your greatest growth there you
find your biggest lessons in life you find your biggest
successes stemming from that being born from it so those
really challenging times a lot of times they are the
seeds for our ultimate success so don't be so quick
to dismiss those as being bad and that is what
you're doing most of the time most of the time
when you're thinking negatively when you're worrying when you're afraid
when you're really angry or you're feeling hurt I mean
it feels real and it is real I mean it
hurts it gets you mad it gets you anxious but
if you start to become more of a positive thinker
you really start to buy into this deeper philosophy you
start to realize that that's not necessary and then in
fact a lot of times you're worrying about the things
that are really good for you the things that are
really going to make you grow the things that are
really going to make you successful there's something to this
idea that there can be no problem that is not
an opportunity in your life and I think this is
what the core of positive thinking is is understanding that
every problem every challenge that you have is ultimately an
opportunity and this is not just some wishful thinking this
has not said lightly this is something that takes some
study this has takes some study and some contemplation to
understand it takes wisdom to really understand this you have
to have some life experience to start to see the
truth of this the depth of it because there's like
a surface level understanding and then how much deeper layer
of understanding that's why you have to kind of go
back and look at your own history just try to
prove it to yourself to prove yourself this is true
because right now I tell you this but you're probably
saying yes this sounds nice and sure it could probably
work for many problems in my life I can see
that somehow I'm catastrophizing them exaggerating them a lot of
times they don't come true but you know there's just
this one problem I've got right now I've got this
one problem that's just pure hell it's pure hell it's
pure evil there's no possible way that this problem I've
got right here there's no possible way that this could
have any opportunity in it there's no opportunity here there's
no lesson to be learned here there's nothing pot this
is just pure negative if I could remove it from
my life my life would be happy I would be
better I just know it well that's exactly what I'm
trying to tell you is that that's not positive thinking
and I mean I understand where you're coming from a
lot of times I get triggered like that too and
I was especially like that a lot in the past
and I'm still a bit like that today but you
can understand that this is the mode of thinking that
you've been coming from for most of your life and
that that mode of thinking has gotten you to where
you are right now in your life so that's gotten
you to where you are but that's only gotten you
to where you are and I'm willing to bet that
you can do better than where you are right now
and if you really want to go to that next
level then what you have to do is you have
to start to think in a different way sometimes if
I start thinking in a radically different way a way
that seems uncomfortable a way that seems wishful thinking at
first a way that seems unrealistic that seems idealistic that
seems fantastical yet there is something to this idea that
nothing can happen to you that is not positive I
guarantee you that if you really look at it if
I really sat down with you and we really looked
at that challenge you have right now that's totally unsolvable
that's ruining your life if we looked at it we
can pick out I guarantee we can pick out something
positive something you could learn from it of course this
doesn't mean that all the sudden your problems to be
fixed it doesn't mean that your problem is not a
real problem it doesn't mean that you shouldn't work to
fix your problem it doesn't mean that you don't feel
the pains of your problem I'm not denying you any
of that but I am saying that once you adopt
this mindset and you become a positive thinker then you're
going to be able to Aikido a lot of your
problems the art of Aikido it's a it's a martial
art and one of the philosophies there is that you
use the the force of your opponent as as a
vehicle of taking him down so when an opponent lunges
at you or he tries to do some move at
you what you do is you kind of roll with
the flow you roll with the problem right you roll
with the punch that's coming at you and you deflect
it and you you don't just stop it or block
it or avoid it you actually use it and you
transfer the momentum from it into something that's going to
serve you so it goes from being a negative where
the punch is coming at your face to all the
sudden within a split second it turns into a big
positive because now you've got the opponent and you've taken
them and now you've been able to convert that punch
that he threw at your face you converted it into
some sort of advantage for you tactical advantage in combat
for you now the opponent is lying on the ground
and you've got them in a in some sort of
pin because you were able to do some move that
Aikido the problem into something to your advantage that's what
true passe of thinking is and on a practical level
this the supply is very easily to every problem that
you have I want you to start thinking from now
on for every problem that you've got a little one
to the biggest one always remember to think what can
I get from this what is going to be the
lesson what am I going to learn how is this
going to grow me how is this going to lead
to my ultimate victory to my ultimate success and this
is going to take a lot from you because this
is something that's very unnatural especially if you are prone
to anxious neurotic thinking and you've been doing that your
whole life you've got that habit built up and it's
not going to be very easy for you to even
remember this it takes consciousness it takes awareness because those
problems you've got what they do is they trigger you
they trigger a base emotional response within you and that
response it just comes about or less naturally it's like
a trigger you get a stimulus and then you get
a response a stimulus and then a response and you're
just a stimulus response animal you're not actually behaving consciously
if you want to become a positive thinker then you
have to remember what I'm telling you now and the
next time that you have a problem big or small
you have to try to remember and stay conscious and
even though you are going to feel some of the
pain and the fear and the anxiety and whatever else
I want you to remember what I'm telling you is
say okay even though this is a problem it feels
very real there's something I can draw from it something
positive I can draw from it and when you're able
to do that that's when you really develop positive thinking
one quote really powerful quote on this topic positive thinking
that I got from Tony Robbins really resonated with me
and I want to share with you guys and it
goes like this you will be truly cheerful in life
the day that you realize that no matter what is
happening around you being anything other than cheerful will not
make it any better there's something about this that rings
very true very wise because the all the optimum strategy
the optimum strategy is to be cheerful in every situation
no matter how bad it is no matter who dies
if you remain cheerful that is that is going to
lead to the best possible outcome you're not going to
gain anything by being scared you're not going to gain
anything by being angry you're not going to gain anything
by by feeling hurt or sad that's not to say
that any of those emotions should ever be felt you'll
be able to feel them you're not gonna be able
to stop them anyways but when you can really live
from this place you can you can just you can
almost feel how different your life is going to be
your life would be very different if you were always
cheerful no matter what was happening it takes strength and
courage to be able to do this that's why most
people can do it that's why people are so negative
and their performance in life is so shot is because
they're not cheerful and I guarantee you that the quality
of your life is going to be directly proportional to
how cheerful you can stay no matter what's happening around
you especially those very negative times you have to remain
positive you have to remain hopeful you just have to
do it because there's something positive there for you to
extract that's a reality that's a truth that's not wishful
thinking okay so to really bring this point home for
you guys what I'm going to give you is I'm
going to give you an exercise this is something that
you can practically do to really get your positive thinking
muscles trained up this is a really challenging exercise so
if you can do it successfully I really applaud you
and what is it it's called the seven day positivity
challenge you might have heard of it the seven day
positivity challenge what does this mean this means that for
seven days you choose when it starts for seven days
you commit to thinking zero negative thoughts for seven days
straight that means all you think are positive thoughts now
of course even if you make this intention negative thoughts
will still creep up that's okay but as soon as
you notice and are aware of the negative thought as
soon as you're aware of it and you label it
you have to drop it within 60 seconds and not
think about it again and move on to something else
you either start to think something positive about the situation
or you just change topic entirely and start thinking about
something else or just distract yourself but you're not allowed
to think about that negative thought anymore and then when
a negative negative thought comes up a little bit later
in the day again you recognize it and the Sunnis
recognize it within 60 seconds you drop it and you
think something positive or you distract yourself with some other
thought and so the idea is that you do this
for seven days straight and you have to do it
perfectly so if a negative thought comes up and you
find yourself thinking about it and thinking about it and
thinking about it and then you notice that you are
thinking about it and then another five minutes pass and
you're still thinking about it another five ends pass and
you're still thinking about it you failed if 60 seconds
pass and you're still thinking about it you failed and
you have to restart the whole challenge from scratch so
this is a really tough challenge I really encourage you
to try this because it's a lot tougher than it
sounds if you've never tried this when you do try
it you'll realize first of all just how many negative
thoughts you're having it will shock you you also shock
you how much you dwell on them even though they're
not resourceful at all it will shock you how many
unrest or soldats you're basically having in your life and
it will also shock you at the potential that you
have the potential you have at mastering your own psychology
because when you see that wow if I could just
eliminate all these negative thoughts and I if I could
just last for seven days straight with positive thinking you're
going to see wow like that's that's a powerful potential
change that I could make to my whole life how
would that impact my work how would that impact my
relationships my family life my you know my money situation
my health you're going to see it and if you
actually make it through seven days you're also going to
actually prove it to yourself because those seven days will
probably be some of the best seven days that you've
had in your life up to now because when you
think positively for seven days straight Wow you're going to
feel it just going to make you feel awesome you're
probably also going to accomplish a lot of stuff and
you're probably gonna be very creative in that timeframe so
