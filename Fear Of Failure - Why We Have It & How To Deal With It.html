hey this is Leo for actualised dialogue and in this
quick self-help segment we are going to talk about fear
failure and how to overcome it so I'm going to
give you some quick and practical techniques and insights for
how to really deal with the fear of failure alright
so what is the fear of failure let's talk about
that for a second fear of failure is basically something
that every one of us has this is what holds
every one of us back from living a charged kind
of life from living to our full potential because fact
is that the world is dangerous there are things out
there that we need to look out for and that
in our biology in our psychology through hundreds and thousands
of years of evolution what has happened is that we've
been programmed with just ways of thinking and dealing with
situations in fearful ways because fear is a very good
quick hit of stimulation that gets you to change your
behavior and that is kind of like the carrot and
stick model of motivation and that's how our reptilian brain
works is that when you're faced with a real danger
when you're walking through the jungle and all of a
sudden you see a tiger then you've got literally a
physical response happening in your brain and you're especially in
your reptilian brain that is just taking over all of
you and it is sending you into action that's the
flight-or-fight response and all of a sudden you're geared you're
motivated within a split second you're filled with adrenaline and
you're off you're running away or you're grabbing a stick
to fend off the tiger or whatever you're doing that's
totally natural and that's the environment we grew up in
because we've evolved through millions of years of survival of
the fittest right it is kind of a dog-eat-dog world
but actually now that we're living in a more humane
society where we don't have to be at each other's
throats all the time that fear is still present and
we still have all these fears that grip us but
in fact the dangers are not nearly as great as
as they were and what happens is this fear paralyzes
it holds us back and makes us very very conservative
and safety minded rather than growth minded and so we
become afraid of trying new things and fear of failure
is basically an aspect of that what I was talking
about but also ties in with with perfectionism right it's
thinking that when you do something that it's gonna have
to go well it's gonna have to be perfect and
then if it's not and somehow you failed and somehow
that's like the worst thing that could possibly happen to
you I feel very qualified to talk about this topic
because I have a lot of fear of failure still
even though I've done years and years of personal development
work and I've studied so many numerous techniques and strategies
and ideas about this stuff fact is that it's really
hard to get rid of fear of failure entirely it's
something you have to chip away at slowly as slowly
and slowly and the best way to really deal with
fear of failure is one to put yourself in a
position where you're relatively safe and secure so if you're
really in a dangerous and hostile environment not just in
your mind but I mean really in a hostile environment
like if you were in in some poor country in
Africa where you really face a danger of getting your
arms chopped off with a machete that's a hostile environment
you living in a suburb in the United States it's
not a hostile environment so if you're not really hostile
environment then you have to definitely handle that but if
you're living in a in a comfortable sort of secure
environment that most of us live in in a first
world country then the fear of failure is largely your
mind play tricks on you and what it's doing is
it's looking at your past childhood and it's looking at
those experiences and your subconscious mind is bringing forward the
things that you're afraid of the most and for everybody
that's gonna be slightly different so maybe you were raised
in a family where you were always told that you
have to be a certain way otherwise you're not going
to be loved and so now you have a real
fear of of disappointing people and so there's a real
fear that if you don't live up to be able
to expectations they didn't feel like you failed and that
you are unlovable or remember you grew up in a
family situation where you didn't have a lot of money
and so the thing that was instilled in you was
the fear that you're gonna be poor and broke and
now you're an adult and even if you have a
relatively good amount of money in your bank account you
might still be walking around and holding this this limiting
belief or holding this image in your mind in your
subconscious mind this powerful image that one day if you
don't handle all your affairs correctly you're gonna wind up
like that bum on the street and your mind comes
up with all sorts of stories and excuses for why
that's true and in fact if you have that if
you have that fear right now then you're probably sitting
there and saying well leo it is true if I
don't go to work if I don't handle my affairs
I am going to be a bum on the street
so yes technically it's true in that sense but the
problem is and the problem with this whole fear of
failure is that really it's a mechanism that has become
dysfunctional fear can be functional in propria tiger in the
jungle example that was a very appropriate reaction to fear
where it's not appropriate is most likely how its functioning
in your life right because it's keeping you for pursuing
your full potential it's keeping you in your comfort zone
so for example maybe you feel like you should step
it up at work and go ask for that promotion
or maybe ask for a raise but you have a
fear of failure well what if I go and I
ask for that raise and they tell me no that's
gonna feel horrible I'm gonna get rejected and what if
what if not only do they not did then I
give me the raise but what if they tell me
that they're firing me now because I was too bold
and going up and asking for a raise well see
what's happening there is you're creating this worst-case scenario and
what's happening at your lower self that very conservative side
of you is is taking that scenario of you being
a bum on the street and it's magnifying it and
it's it's having you it's having you just like spill
into every aspect of your life in all thinking in
all the thinking that you do about your life and
what that's doing is it's holding you back because the
fact is that yes there might be some risk in
going and asking for promotion but on the hand how
do you want to live your life do you want
to live your life in cost and failure or do
you want to live your life going out there and
pushing your comfort zone trying new things here's the trick
about failure is that failure is actually good failure is
not as bad as your mind makes it out to
be failure is how really successful people get successful it's
something that are born successful is that they go through
a process of trial and error making lots of mistakes
failing many times to learn those hard lessons to get
those lessons wired into their brains and then they can
have the success that they have because they've tried it
all they fail so many times they don't care anymore
that's kind of what you need to do is you
need to numb yourself down to this idea that failure
is bad it's not bad in fact I can bet
you that if I was with you right now 101
and I asked you tell me about a time in
your life where you really really struggled a lot and
you failed a lot and you still kept with it
but you failed so any time you just tried so
many times you kept failing and failing and failing and
failing but you just kept with it and you just
kept with it and you just kept with it what
we'll probably find is that that actually led to something
very positive in your life because what happened through that
process that you learned something through that failure process eventually
you came out with some new insight you came out
with some new skill set you came out with some
new asset that you created or maybe a relationship that
sprung out of that something positive and that came out
of the direct result that you got understanding by doing
this trial and this trial and error process and that
is how learning happens through failure when a little child
starts to learn how to walk what does he do
he doesn't he doesn't say to himself well what if
I fail what if I take that force evidence at
work he's not cautious of that at all if he
had that kind of mindset none of us would ever
walk fortunately enough when you're at that age you're in
your instincts kind of just kick in and you start
walking you start experimenting but you see them what you
see them doing is you see them struggling and trying
and falling down and going again and again and again
but they're getting enjoyment out of it and it's kind
of like a game it's like a fun challenge right
fun challenge they're trying it out even though maybe sometimes
they land on their ass they get hurt they get
bruised they slip they chip a tooth whatever knock their
head on on a bench but like they're learning through
that process and that that's necessary so this idea that
you fear failing in your career and your business and
your relationship so what so what if you fail nothing
that bad is gonna happen right and think about it
if a friend came to you right now and he
was really really anxious and neurotic about failing on some
some project that he's working on or like really screwing
up a conversation with somebody or giving a speech and
like making a fool of himself or whatever else what
would you tell him you tell them exactly what I'm
telling you is you tell them you know how important
is it in the grand scheme of things if you
if you bomb that test if you bomb that relationship
if you if you bomb that speech if you bomb
your marriage it's really not that important and some of
these things I want to make sure that I'm being
clear here I'm not just saying little things I'm saying
all things I specifically said something like a marriage because
a marriage is a is a big thing and most
people would say well you don't want to bomb your
marriage and I'm not saying that you should deliberately but
I'm saying that in the end you're going to do
your best and your best sometimes isn't good enough sometimes
you need to learn through the school of hard knocks
and sometimes bombing that marriage is exactly what needs to
happen to you and you know what there's nothing that
bad about it in the end you're making out to
be too big of a deal and you know this
because if I came to you with the same problem
you would say you know what there's a bright side
to it you'll learn something you'll know how to create
a better marriage maybe you'll find out that you're better
off alone whatever it's not that big of a deal
if you fail you can't hold yourself to this perfectionistic
standard and so that's basically the bottom line and I
think that if you want that exciting kind of life
if you want to go and undertake this process of
self actualization as I call it then you have to
be willing to fail and you have to be willing
to accept some risk and going out there doing stuff
otherwise what's gonna happen is you're like a bird in
a cage you're going nowhere you can't get out of
the cage you don't want to get out of the
cage even if the door is opened you still feel
comfortable in the cage and how can you grow how
can you really live how can you experience life you
can't and that's why your life is average it's boring
it's mediocre you don't have really good results in finances
or in relationships or anywhere else because you're in a
cage we don't want that and the best way to
get out of that cage is to make the choice
for growth versus the comfort Abraham Maslow talks about this
he's kind of the father of self-actualization he talks about
that every day you get little choices and the choice
is always between growth and comfort so for example when
you wake up in the morning do you push the
snooze alarm that's comfort or do you force yourself to
get up and do what you got to do that's
growth do you grab the doughnut or the the healthy
piece of fruit or salad at lunch you know that's
again a choice between comfort and growth and do you
go and you raise your hand at the group meeting
and you voice your concerns that's growth or do you
tell yourself to sit down and shut up and be
meek that's comfort so you get these little decision points
every single day we all get them dozens of them
and the more you can you can go with the
choice of growth versus comfort that's air that's every day
you're doing that it's a little snap a little step
a little step towards breaking out of your shell at
your comfort zone out of your cage and that is
ultimately how you become self actualized and that is how
you defeat and overcome the fear of failure all right
