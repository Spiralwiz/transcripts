Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to rant against the pickup community. And if
you're a guy who's involved in pickup, this is a
must watch episode for you you selfish, narcissistic, dishonest fuck.
You are so fucking busted right now, watch. And listen,
as I burst your little bubble of pickup bullshit. Despite
what it sounds like I'm about to make some very
nuanced psychological points about pickup. I'm going to give you
a very accurate character profile of people who do pickup
and of yourself if you're involved in pickup. And what
you're not aware of yet is you're not aware of
the deeper psychological principles at play, that are driving you
to do pickup in the way that you do. And
in a sense, what I can offer you is I
can offer you a glimpse into your future and a
glimpse into yourself in a deeper way than you can
offer yourself in a sense, I know you better than
you than you know yourself. So one warning that I
want to give you here right off the bat is
you need to be extremely self honest here. Because there's
a lot of potential for self deception. Be very self
honest, as you're listening to me now, and be very
open minded, because some of the things I'm going to
tell you are going to go against the grain of
what you've been learning over the last few years. So
one really big lie of the Pua community in general,
is something like this. And you've probably heard this a
lot. Is that mainstream society rags on pu A's and
pick up and basically, it doesn't understand us. Pick up
is no good to mainstream society, but mainstream society, it
rags on pickup for no good reason. Right? It's not
what the pickup community has told you. It's something like
well, they don't understand us they don't understand if they
understood it, they really got involved and really saw what's
what's going on. And they saw how much I'm growing
and, and how much I'm learning and all this good
that's happening, then they would totally change their mind about
pickup. Now, this is a big load of horseshit, big
load of horseshit big lie of the Pua community. And
there's many actually good reasons and valid reasons for why
mainstream society frowns upon pickup. And I'm going to talk
about a lot of them here in a lot of
depth. So keep your mind open. Now for the record,
before you start to question me. And before you dismiss
me what I'm about to say, for the record, I've
done close to 1000 hours of live infield pickup. I've
gone to many py seminars. I've studied and watched many
different P weigh products, hundreds of hours of different Pua
theory and products and techniques. I've coached many P ways
with their relationship issues and their issues with women. And
I also have a lot of P way friends. So
I've surround myself with a lot of pickup, guys, right?
So it's not like I'm coming at this from the
perspective of like, oh, I never did pick up and
I just learned about it. And it sounds evil. That's
not the perspective. I'm coming from coming from it as
like an insider, right? Most of my friends in fact
are P ways. And they're good friends of mine. But
I see that they're missing something. Right. So this is
really coming from a place of love for me, because
I want to help you get to the next level
of your personal development I want to help you to
self actualize. When I first started pickup, that was like,
maybe four years ago now. I was bad with girls,
right? So I was the kind of the typical newbie
pickup guy. I really need to help in that department.
I know the techniques or the theory. So I just
sort of learning and eating it all up. And I
loved all the personal development aspects of pickup too. So
that was just like the perfect match for me at
the time. Maybe you can relate to that. But when
I first started, my intuition still told me that there's
something fishy about this community. Like yes, it's cool that
I can get better with girls, I want that. But
still, it's like my higher self is telling me Wait
a minute. Some of the stuff I'm reading on these
forums and some of the things I'm hearing with, you
know, these instructors and these coaches telling me certain things
I should do or giving me little anecdotes of what
they've done. It's like, man, that's that's not quite right
or wrong about that sounds fishy about that. But at
that point, you know, I didn't really care too much.
I didn't know how to really define what was wrong,
I couldn't quite put my finger on it. It took
me several years of doing actual pickup and observing myself,
and then also several more years of much deeper personal
development work, after getting out of pickup, to really start
to wrap my mind around what was wrong. And I'm
going to lay out the issues with the pickup community
right here. Fundamentally, what's going on is that that the
foundation of pickup itself is flawed. It's flawed for three
main reasons. The first is that the pickup community is
predicated upon the following assumption is that you will have
fulfilment by sleeping with lots of hot women. And that
right there is just a complete fail. If you really
understand how human psychology works, this cannot possibly work under
any conditions. In fact, if anything, it's going to create
a lot of suffering in your life, it's going to
backfire on you. But that's not something you can appreciate
when you're just desperate for sex. When you're just desperate
for sex, you just want a girlfriend. You know, you've
been that nerd, that Shy Guy your whole life, it
really feels like if you fix your shyness, if you
become confident if you become that alpha male guy, and
you can get all the girls you want. And you
can get your dream girlfriend, that you think that that's
going to fix all your problems. And now you're going
to be fulfilled. And I got news for you. That's
not going to fulfill you at all. It won't. It's
a giant illusion. And this is something that's perpetuated within
the pickup community. Nobody really talks about this. They just
kind of like sweep it under the rug. It's like
well, yeah, we kind of know that sleeping with girls.
Isn't that fulfilling? But Oh, who cares? Anyways, we're just
gonna go chase after more girls. It's kind of like
this kind of mentality. So that's one deep flaw of
the foundation of pickup. Another deep flaw. And this is
perhaps even more damning is that the Pua community glorifies
the lower self and ego despite what it says, And
it's funny, there's an irony, because in the pickup community,
we actually talk about breaking down the ego, killing the
ego and this kind of talk. But that's really far
from what's actually going on. When you're doing pickup. It's
the exact opposite. And if you hung around, like pickup
forums, or you have a circle of pickup friends that
you go out with and stuff like that, then you're
gonna resonate exactly and understand exactly what I'm talking about
here. When I read you this following quote, this is
a quote that has very deep psychological wisdom. So listen,
really close because is a perfect description of what you
and your friends are doing. Quote, the lower self tries
to fulfill desire for pleasure to survive each day. It
collects and hoards resources, lies, cheats, seduces, complains, rages B.
littles worships power, money and sex, withhold attention and love
to gain compliance does anything to gain the upper hand,
feels superior to others hates to lose. Such self centered
and narcissistic qualities were responsible for humankind's survival long ago,
and quote, that is a quote by Rhys Thomas. Very
powerful quote, when I read this quote, a few months
ago, in my mind, immediately, it's like a light bulb
went on. It's like, oh, this is the perfect point
by point description of what a typical Pua is like.
And this is exactly the problem with Pua is because
the pickup community espouses values that actually glorify this, this
thing, right, this whole process of the lower self doing
its thing, it doesn't try to kind of like reduce
it, and to suppress it and to transcend it, it
actually glorifies it. And then the third deep flaw in
the foundation of pickup is that at heart, it's immature.
It's really juvenile. If you take a look at how
P waves talk, how they walk, how they carry themselves,
how they think, how they relate to other human beings,
including men and women, how they set their goals, what
they're motivated by, it's really like a step above high
school. Right? You know, you're like near maturing, there's high
school, then you go to college. It's like it's a
little bit like above, kind of the frat boy in
college, you might say it's a little higher. Quality of
consciousness, but not much higher. And on the other hand,
it pretends it acts as though it's a really high
level of consciousness, when nothing is further from the truth,
actually a very low level of consciousness. But see kind
of the trick that the pickup committee plays on you
is that it creates this kind of like, distortion field,
where it feels like actually, you're maturing, and you're growing.
But let's face it, your motivations are very immature. I
mean, what are you doing, you're spending hundreds and 1000s
of hours chasing vagina. That's basically what you're doing. And
also, you're doing some personal growth, and you're going to
the gym and you're eating a little healthier. I mean,
that's all kind of like, good to sprinkle in there.
That's all sounds nice. But fundamentally, what are you doing,
you're chasing vagina, that's what you're doing. And that can't
help but come back to bite you in the ass.
So those are the three points there, I still have
a lot more to say, though. Let me now give
you a prediction of your psychological development. Because you know
what, I got some shocking news for you. You're not
the first human being who's ever been on this planet,
and who has grown and matured through life, there's actually
a, a well known process through which the human psyche
matures and develops, Clare graves, has developed one such model,
he was a psychologist and researcher. And he developed the
Clare graves model, and it was turned into the spiral
dynamics model. And I talked about it's a very deep
and profound model of psychological development. And I talked about
it, I have a whole over hour long video that
talks about it. But here, I want to give you
just a really quick little recap of what this really
means and why it's important to you, at this point
in your life. See, well, clearly, what Claire graves discovered
is that human beings evolve from one stage to the
next stage to the next stage. And it's a predictable
pattern. A lot of times people get stuck in one
stage for the rest of their life, and they never
go any higher. But what's true about this is that
you can't skip stages. And the stages come in a
very particular order. And once you understand the stages, you
can very clearly see like, Oh, I'm right here, and
I just came from over there. And the next place
I'm gonna go to is over here, and two steps
up above that is this thing over here. And it
just gives you a really clear understanding of where you're
at in life, and how mature you really are. So
where you are in the Clare graves model, is he's
got stages, and he gets them different colors. So the
color that you're at, there's red, there's blue, and then
there's orange, and there's green, those are the ones we're
gonna be concerned, there's more colors, but those are the
ones we're gonna be concerned with. So the red color,
what is that, that is almost like criminal behavior, that's
highly egotistical behavior, where you're completely absorbed with acquiring power
for yourself. So this just imagine a mafia boss, or
a gang leader, or like a drug dealer, or a
criminal or a thief, or like a dictator, old school
style dictator, or like a tribal leader, those people acquire
lots of power through brute force. Right? So that's one
stage of consciousness, then what happens is that you evolve
out of that stage of consciousness, because you see that
it's just, it's too negative. And then you go into
the next stage, which is actually kind of a reaction
against that, and you become the the one who enforces
the social hierarchy. This is stage blue. At this stage,
you're concerned about how do I make society function, you
move and react away from the ego, and you suppress
the ego and you say, Okay, I'm going to serve
society, I'm going to be a good citizen. I'm going
to follow the religious principles and the cultural norms of
my society, I'm gonna be a good little boy and
a good little girl. So here, what happens is you
get civilizations arising. And here you get the rise of
church and state. Here, you get political systems and governments
happening here you have civilization really starting to flourish. And
in this case, there's a lot of dogmatic thinking. A
lot of what we would shy away from nowadays, because
what it is, is it's kind of like traditionalism. It's
conservatism. This is something that pickup is reacting against. Have
you noticed that in the pickup community, all these things
I just talked about in stage blue. It's the pickup
unity is all a reaction against that stuff, right? The
pickup community hates groupthink, and it hates like religious doctrines
about sex and it hates you know, like strong cultural
worms in his hates this idea of like, you have
to be a good little boy or good little girl.
So where does that put you as a Pua? Probably
it puts you at stage orange, which is the next
stage, what a stage orange. This is actually where American
culture is that mostly right now, Sage orange is again,
a move away from Blue, and a moving and a
swing of the pendulum back towards towards the ego of
red. But now it's not criminal behavior anymore. Now it's
a little bit more responsible behavior. So you're not technically
probably doing anything illegal, but you're engaging in behavior that's
still selfish. This is what modern American business is like.
Right? So the modern American business philosophy is what it's
to conquer and defeat all your competitors, as efficiently and
ruthlessly as you can. Don't try to do anything illegal.
But if you can use some sneaky underhanded tactics that
are borderline unethical, but not technically illegal, go ahead and
use those. If you have a good strong team of
lawyers use those lawyers to threaten and harass and manipulate
your competitors. Establish a monopoly if you can squeeze out
all your competitors, defeat and absorb everyone and become number
one, acquire lots of money, go public, acquire lots of
stock options become filthy rich, use that money then to
build an opulent lifestyle of your dreams with a giant
house with a Ferrari and Lamborghini. And with lots of
women around you and be happy and live happily ever
after. With all this material wealth that you've accumulated through
your business activities. That's, you know, a caricature of stage
orange, stage orange values, things like individuality nonconformity, uniqueness, technology,
rational thinking, no superstitious type thinking. Breaking out of the
mold thinking outside the box breaking out of the hierarchy.
This is stage orange, this is probably where you're at.
And if you can see the pickup community is really
glorifying this whole stage orange. And in fact, and this
is not something that's unique to the pickup community. But
what the bigger community does is it glorifies stage orange,
by demonizing stage blue, because orange arose out of blue.
And now what orange does is it demonizes blue. And
it talks about how people that are stuck in blue,
how they're very shallow and closed minded. And they don't
really understand that there's this new level they could rise
to, right? Isn't that kind of what you tell your
friends who are stuck at Blue, it's like, Dude, wake
up, become an individual take control of your life. Look
at all this cool stuff you can develop for yourself.
You can grow yourself, you can get the kind of
woman you want, and get the house you want, you
get the kind of life you want. Right, this is
kind of the pickup vision, the pickup dream. But I
have some news for you. And the news is that
there's something beyond stage orange. And that would be stage
green. What's very interesting, this is again, not unique to
pick up the pickup community at all, but that every
organization or individual who is at one of these stages,
is blind to the existence of all the other stages.
And in fact, what they do is they demonize, they
actively demonize the stage directly below them, and of course,
the stage directly above them. This allows them to maintain
homeostasis in the current stage that they're at. And this
is exactly what pickup does pick up not only demonizes
blue, but it also demonizes green. What is stage green
stage green is the relationship stage. This is the stage
where human beings start to relate with each other in
a more authentic and compassionate way. Instead of shallow material
materialism, and success and achievement orientation. What you have at
stage green is actual genuine compassion for other individuals. Your
sphere of concern expands so that now not only do
you care about yourself and your family and your friends,
but you also start to care about the general world
at large. You start to care about society, you start
to care about other cultures. You start to care about
being fair and even and balanced. With the different perspectives
that people have. You start to recognize the validity of
not just your perspective, but also the perspectives of other
cultures and other tribes and other human beings and other
genders. You start to really value Are you authentic relationship?
A really good stereotype for stage green is the hippie.
The hippie is prototypical stage green. What is the kipi
want, the hippie doesn't want money. The hippie wants love,
the hippie wants peace. The hippie wants to save the
whales to protect animals to protect the environment, he's concerned
about global warming. And the polar bears their ice, you
know, the ice melting under the polar bears feet, and
then sinking and drowning. He's, he's concerned about these kinds
of things. And what he's doing here is he's kind
of developing this larger sense of compassion for the world,
and for other living beings. Now, what the pickup community
does, is it actually demonizes this stage green. And of
course, it doesn't believe that sage green is above it,
it believes that sage green is below it. And in
fact, it kind of lump stage green and stage blue
together and calls all those people chose or chumps, or
nice guys, those are the guys who can't get laid.
Those are the guys who aren't cool. It's not cool
to be compassionate. It's not cool to be caring, it's
not cool to be a good human being, it's not
cool to be nice. This is all chump behavior, this
doesn't get you laid. Women don't like it, women don't
respond nicely to it. In fact, they generally mistreat you,
they don't get you what you want, if you act
this way. So all of that is kind of demonized
and put to the side. And then what's Glorified is
stage orange. But here's the prediction now, is that if
what you really care about is you care about personal
growth, and self actualization, what you're gonna have to do
is you're gonna have to move up this hierarchy, up
this ladder, up the staircase, and each step is going
to be painful for you. Each step is going to
require the shedding of ego, the shedding of old concepts
and beliefs and dogmas. And so that's kind of what
we're doing here in this episode, is we're helping you
to see the next step for you. And to get
your mind and your ego ready to take that step.
Because the ego is very resistant, it likes to be
at the stage that it's at, and it doesn't want
to go any higher. Right, so we have to start
to open your mind to the possibility that green is
above orange. And that green is worth working towards. Now
you have two choices, you can either accept that green
exists and move up towards it, or you can deny
that green exists. And anything that I'm telling you here
is, is valid, and you can just insist that orange
is the best that there is. And if you do
that, then your self actualization will stop. And that's exactly
my concern with pickup guys is that it feels like
if they stay in the pickup, you know, world, and
they, they eat up all the pickup concept, and they
just keep going and more and more and more with
it, then they just kind of stifle their growth and
growth peters out. And then they think that they're self
actualizing, when actually they're not. And all the really cool
stuff is all way ahead of you way above you,
you still need to work towards that. So my prediction
is, is that actually as you grow, what will naturally
start to happen to you, you really can't even help
it is that you will start to realize the limitations
of orange. Maybe you've already started to realize it. If
you've been doing pickup for a couple of years real
hard, what you'll probably start to realize is that you
know what? banging a bunch of girls doesn't really make
me fulfilled. In fact, it's kind of empty and depressing.
And, you know, being that confident, Suave, charming guy at
the club. Yeah, it's kind of cool on the surface.
But deep down, my life feels kind of hollow. Like,
what I would really want is I want to build
a deeper connection with with an individual woman, or I
would really want to build some deeper connections with my
friends and the pickup friends that I have. Yes, we're
good friends, because we all like pickup, but our connections
and our friendships are actually quite shallow. They're not really
that deep. Maybe I need to rethink my paradigm here.
Maybe just acquiring more money and getting more muscles and
getting ripped and having a six pack. And, and all
these goals and all this achievement that I'm pursuing alongside
pickup, maybe that stuff has a an upper limit to
it. Ha ha, all maybe I can allow myself to
expand into something new. See, that's the trend that will
start to happen with you. Now the only question really
is is how long will it take? It could take
a year could take five years could take you 20
years. It's also possible that you're so stuck on yourself.
And so narcissistic that basically you will never ever outgrow
stage orange. That's certainly possible as well. But what I'm
claiming is that this is what's going to happen to
you. Right. And the reason that I can claim this
is because there's been a lot of scientific studies and
evidence done on the Clare graves model, and other psychological
developmental models and what they found, generally speaking, you know,
this is just a trend that we're talking about. It's
not necessarily your destiny. But generally speaking, this is how
human psyches develop, and you are a human psyche. So
you will tend to develop this way. So that was
important to clear up this developmental model. Now, let me
be clear, and just clear up a couple of points
here. Firstly, let me be clear, and say that pickup
does get you laid. There's no doubt about that. So
I am not here, questioning or criticizing pickup on the
grounds that it will not get you a lot of
hot women to sleep with. If you do pickup effectively,
and you follow the strategies. In general, the theory works
extremely well, the techniques work extremely well. So you can
demonstrate that for yourself. And if you've been doing pickup,
then you probably already have. So no question about that.
Also, be careful, I'm not making a moral case against
pickup here. I am not saying that pickup is evil
or wrong. And that's why you should stop doing pickup.
Also note that I am not making a social case
against pickup, I am not telling you that pickup is
wrong, and you should stop doing it because it's socially
unacceptable behavior, or it's it's somehow culturally unacceptable behavior. I'm
not really making that case here. What I am gonna
make though, is the case that self actualization is limited
by your pickup. So it's really a case of self
actualization. you're limiting your own growth, you're shooting yourself in
the foot when you stay in the pickup community for
too long, and you buy into the pickup belief system
too much. Alright, so got that out of the way.
Now let me go into the real meat of what
I want to talk about, which is a kind of
a point by point critique of the various aspects of
pickup that society frowns upon for good reasons to address
this core central lie of the pickup community, which is
that there are no good reasons for why mainstream society
frowns upon pickup actually, there are many good reasons. And
here they are. The first important problem with pickup is
that it's selfish and anti spiritual, selfish and anti spiritual.
What does this mean? Especially anti spiritual? That sounds kind
of weird. What does that mean? Let me first address
this, the selfish component. So what pickup really is, is
a neurotic overreaction. An erotic overreaction of the psyche? If
you actually talk in depth with pickup guys, and you
learn about their life story, and you learn about why
are they motivated to be and to do pickup in
the first place, what you start to discover very quickly
is that the vast majority of them are coming from
a place of emotional pain. So what happened to them
is that either they got dumped, they got divorced, they
had a really bad breakup, or they were shy their
whole life, or they were that nerd that girls didn't
like in high school, and everyone laughed at, or, you
know, something happened to them, that now they're really driven
to get better with women, for whatever reason. And I'm
not saying there's anything wrong with that. I'm just saying,
just notice that. Generally, if you talk about pickup, or
you try to convince someone who isn't coming from an
emotionally wounded place in their life or in their childhood,
and you try to convince them to do pickup, immediately,
what happens is that they are a little standoffish. And
usually what the pickup community tells you about that, they
say, Well, these guys have been socially conditioned. They're just
chumps. They don't really understand. But that's not actually what's
going on. Actually, these people don't have emotional wounds. So
they don't feel like they need to do a whole
neurotic overreaction to get over their wounds. You see, so
to them when they see a pickup guy investing hundreds
and 1000s of hours, learning and studying how to manipulate
women to them. It seems kind of weird. It's like,
Dude, why are you doing that? Just be normal. Be
cool. Be yourself. Right? That's what they tell you. Women
tell you the same thing. But us pick up guys.
We're like, No, we can't be ourselves. You don't understand.
It's not that easy. I have to go through this
whole gauntlet, this whole ordeal. Why is that? Well, because
you're emotionally wounded. Those people can understand that because they're
not emotionally wounded. That's interesting. That's an interesting phenomenon. And
if you actually take a look at pickup instructors and
you study their life histories, what you'll see is that
many of them not not all of them But many
of them come from this kind of background. And you
can verify that for yourself. The other problem here is,
is the selfishness component, right? So when you're doing pickup
Really, all you care about is yourself. Right? You don't
have much compassion for the women, or the men that
you run across, in, in your, you know, in field
activities. It's like, what's the, what's the pickup philosophy, it's
like, Damn, what the woman wants, Damn her agenda doesn't
matter if she's a girl, if she has a boyfriend,
or if she needs to go with her girlfriends tomorrow,
or if she needs to go to work tomorrow, doesn't
matter. I just need to have sex with her. I'll
do whatever I can to get her to have sex
with me. Right? Exactly, exactly. But don't deny that. Also,
same thing for guys. It's like, you know, if there's
a guy in set with you, and he's like, ruining
your set, then you have the right to come in
there, and you have the right to kind of like
screwed him, and to ridicule him and humiliate him and
throw him out of the set. And take the girl
is this kind of attitude. That's an attitude of selfishness.
Have you noticed that there's not really much compassion, there's
no room for compassion pick up, not if you are
really interested in being in the hottest girls in the
largest quantities. It's also selfish in the sense that you're
stuck at stage orange on the greatest model, right? And
you need to evolve to stage green stage green is
the empathy stage. It's where you actually develop compassion, authentic
compassion for other human beings, both men and women. This
is something that's lacking at your current stage, which is
orange, maybe even your kind of borderline stage red. Some
pickup guys are so hardcore, that it makes me question
whether they're even at Orange. It's like, man, part of
your personality type is just like, borderline criminal, like borderline
red, right? Like really? Kinda like nasty lowbrow stuff. Now,
I'm not most pickup, guys. But some. Also, what I've
noticed, have you noticed this is that P waves in
an odd sense, make poor friends? This might strike you
as weird because you would say something like, Well, no,
Leo, I have some of the greatest P wave friends
ever that I've made through the pickup community. And that's
true on the surface. But if you look real deep
at what's going on there, in a sense, those pickup
friends you have are kind of shallow. Have you noticed
that the only times you're really able to bond with
them and to be friends with them is when it's
based on pickup. And as soon as like you get
out of pickup, then all of a sudden, you're not
even talking to those POA friends of yours anymore. There's
a total complete disconnect. What that shows you is that
the friendship is fragile is built on a very weak
bond, which is this, this very, you know, shared common
interest of banging bunch of girls. And that's great. And
I've made a lot of friends based on that shared
common interest, but it's also kind of shallow. It's also
kind of selfish. Have you noticed that your pickup friends,
they're not really the best friends, because they are very
egotistical, narcissistic and selfish. And so if you ask them
just to come to with you to the park, or
if you ask them for a favor, or you know,
you do just kind of more kind of like chumpy
just kind of friend stuff that they generally don't do
it. Like they don't follow through, they don't show up
on time, or they're just kind of flaky. Or they
just, they're, you know, they're off doing their own thing.
They're kind of like living in their own little world.
And a lot of times like they're really heavy into
pickup. So if you're heavy into pickup, it works out
great. But as soon as you start being heavy into
pickup it that relationship just kind of crumbles and withers
away. Kind of funny, huh? tells you there's something deeper
going on there. Now, let me explain the anti spiritual
component of pickup. The reason that pickup is anti spiritual
is how do I explain this? Well, what is spirituality?
Spirituality is recognition that there is no ego is the
transcendence of the ego is the letting go of narcissism
and materialistic pursuits, including the pursuit of sex and carnal
pleasure. So it's anti spiritual because you believe you're gonna
get fulfilment by having sex, or by looking cool, or
by getting ripped, or by earning lots of money by
charging your, you know, your dream business, or whatever other
materialistic goals you have. But this is all anti spiritual,
because fundamentally, these things will not make you fulfilled. In
fact, the more you pursue these kinds of materialistic external
goals, the more the more suffering you're gonna have in
your life, the more frustrated you're going to be, and
maybe you started to experience that. Now, you might counter
me with an argument that goes like this, we say
Uh, well, no Leo pickup is all about building my
inner game, like I'm becoming more confident I'm becoming a
stronger man and so forth. And yes, in a sense,
you know, there are those components to pick up. Now,
you might even say No, those are the strongest components
in proper pickup. And I would say, yes, but still,
those are still highly narcissistic ways. You're building your inner
game, yes, but you're doing it in a very narcissistic
and selfish way. Not in a very spiritual way. You're
fundamentally deceiving yourself about the growth that you're doing. Yes,
you're growing, but you're not really growing at like the
really deep root level, you're growing in surface level ways.
And I've personally seen this in a lot of the
pickup clients that I've coached, because when I coach them,
even guys who are really good with women, and I'm
like, shocked at how good they are, and how and
you know, they seem very confident, but kind of deep
down there hollow inside, or there's something kind of like
rotten at the core. And this is not fixed by
just doing more pickup. There's another kind of live pickup
unity is that says that, well just go out there
to approach a bunch of girls, you know, approach 10,000
Girls, and eventually, all your inner game issues will autocorrect.
That's actually not true. I haven't found that to be
the case at all. And actually, it's not possible, actually.
Because what you're doing when you're talking to lots of
girls, yes, you're developing these nice skills for talking to
girls, and you're developing a sense of confidence. But still,
fundamentally, that confidence that you're developing is predicated upon you
being really good with girls. It's not really a true
core confidence. And what you find with good pickup guys,
even who, you know, bang, really hot girls in large
quantities, is you find that they're actually insecure inside, you
find that actually, they have a low self esteem, you
find that actually, you know, they're not as confident as
they seem, when you see them talking to a girl.
They're not competent across the board. Because what's happened is
that they've they haven't addressed the real root issue of
that emotional pain they had when they entered pickup, they
thought that just having sex and getting good with girls
will address that emotional wound. But actually, it never will.
That's something you need to do a lot deeper personal
development work on to actually fix. That's like, Should you
need to go to therapy for or get life coaching
on or do very serious meditation and contemplation work on.
Okay, so that was that point. Another problem with pick
up. And the reason that mainstream society frowns upon pickup
is that it's fundamentally disrespectful to women. A lot of
collateral damage, and a lot of blindness, with Pua guys
about how much collateral damage they do to women. Now,
I'm not saying that all pickup guys hurt women. That's
not true, you know, women have fun with you, and
all that sort of stuff, that's fine. But still, you
cannot deny that the way in which you relate to
women causes quite a bit of collateral damage. Not only
that, but also what I'm going to claim is that
the pickup unity at large is like a conspiracy of
blindness. Towards the suffering, the extent of the suffering is
reduced. It's excused away and it's rationalized away. And one
of the really common ways that's done is by saying,
Well, women are so emotional, they're so logical, there's no
point in reasoning with them. They're just like, stupid. You
know, there's the stupid girls, it doesn't really matter. It's
like, oh, she would have, she would have broke up
with that guy anyways, it doesn't really matter, this kind
of stuff. That's what I'm talking about. What do I
mean by collateral damage? Well, it's all the emotional suffering
that you cause to women. Like when you pressure a
woman to has sleep with you, even though she doesn't
really want to, and then she regrets it the next
morning. Or, it's when you you know, you're flirting with
a girl who has a boyfriend, and you clearly know
she has a boyfriend, but you flirt with her anyways,
maybe you have sex with her, maybe you don't. Either
way, you're kind of encroaching on that territory, and you're
causing some collateral damage in that relationship. Or when you
have sex with the girl and you make her your
girlfriend, but then you still have other girls you're seeing
on the side, and you're not being honest with her
that you're seeing other girls and you just kind of
either lie about it or just ignore it and are
blind to it. And then that causes her a lot
of emotional suffering that you deny. Or when you get
into a relationship with a girl, the way that you
run that relationship is affected by your pickup training and
your pickup mindsets, and then that causes a lot of
collateral damage in the relationship. So it's this kind of
collateral damage I'm talking about. Another problem with the this
point about disrespecting women, is that there's really no concern
for the woman's agenda. This is the fundamental selfishness I
was talking about the narcissism. So it's like, how do
I get everything that I want and make the woman
accept it. You don't have a genuine interest in the
woman's affairs, you don't really care about her, you care
about her only to the extent that she is a
puzzle piece that fits into your life. So again, it's
like, I don't care what she's doing tomorrow, I don't
care if we have sex all night, and then you
know, tomorrow is gonna be late for work, I don't
care about that, screw that. Or it's like, if she's
in the club, with her friends at a bachelorette party.
And her friends wanted to stay there with her for
the night, but you want to, like sneak her off
to have sex with her in your hotel room, then
what you tell yourself is like, well, it doesn't matter
if I steal her from her friends. And that's okay,
we'll just kind of sneak off, it'll be almost secret,
it'll be fun. And she'll enjoy it, and it's gonna
be all good. And yeah, maybe she will enjoy it
to a certain degree. But also, you got to understand
that still, you're breaking the woman's agenda. You gotta understand
as a man, because you are the leader. And the
woman is kind of the follower. And that's kind of
the the biological dynamic that we're we're dealing with, that
women do follow strong men. And if you're the kind
of guy who's just going to be leading her to
hell, she kind of will follow you there. Right. And
this is where you know, a lot of women, they
get into trouble. Because what happens is they start dating
an asshole. And then this asshole really starts taking advantage
of her. And since she's used to leading, she just
kind of follows and goes along with it. And she's
not realizing that this guy does not give a fuck
about her agenda. He's not looking out for her. He's
not really a true leader, see, a true leader actually
cares, genuinely cares about the agenda of his followers. That
is not you. That is not a pickup guy. A
pickup guy generally doesn't care. That's a problem. That's really
going to limit you in life. If you take that
kind of attitude towards leadership in other aspects of your
life, like in business, or with your friends, or in
a in a marriage, or in a long term relationship,
that will lead to disaster. You can't just care about
yourself at the cost of everyone else. That's too damaging
in the long run. Imagine if you behaved that way
with your family. Imagine if I behaved that way with
you? How would you feel about me? What kind of
leader would I be if I was up here and
the only thing I cared about was how to get
myself as rich and as famous as possible. With my
work. My work would be very different. My attitude would
be very different, I would be a lot less giving
with the information that I give, right, there'd be a
totally different tone to the way that I talk in
the way that I present myself. You can just pick
up on this vibe, you can tell the level of
consciousness that a human being is at just by observing
his actions a little bit. And that's exactly what women
and men and mainstream society senses off of you as
a pickup guy. And this is what you've been denying,
and what the pickup community has been denying. Also, the
problem with disrespecting women is that pickup builds up negative
stereotypes of women. false negative stereotypes. So you know what
I'm talking about. If you go on a typical pickup
forum, then you see people calling women slots, whores skanks?
You know, cheaters, they always cheat on you. Women are
disloyal, they're always lying. You know, they have all this
bullshit excuses. They're crazy and emotional, this kind of stuff.
That's what I'm talking about. Now, you might say, well,
Leo, you know, if you actually go into the field,
and you interact with 1000s of women, you'll realize that
women are this way. There is that element, right? All
people are this way to a degree. The problem is
that you're looking at women through this very narrow perspective
of like, how do women behave in the club, when
they're drunk, and they're partying? This kind of thing, you're
not looking at women more holistically. In general, what I
found, and this is something that I had to undo
is that I was doing pickup for a few years
and I kind of absorbed just spontaneously some of these
negative stereotypes about women. And then what I discovered is
that actually, when I'm interacting with women, you know, older
women, middle aged women, elderly women, girls, when I'm interacting
with women in longer term relationships outside the club, outside
of this agenda of mind to pick them up. I
discovered that women really don't fit in Some of these
negative stereotypes that the pickup community feeds into your mind.
And that becomes damaging. And I noticed this in my
friends, too, right? My friends, of course, also develop these
kinds of stereotypes. And some of them are kind of
blind to it. And some of them were not able
to kind of dig themselves out of these stereotypes. And
I think that that hurts you in the long term.
I know it hurts me. Because if I have these
negative stereotypes, and I go into a relationship, like a
serious long term relationship, I can see actually how it's
damaging. It's undermining my relationship, because I can't fundamentally trust
the person. Or I assume something bad about them, when
in fact, it's not true. Another point I want to
make here is about why women are pissed off at
you. So you know, in general, P waves don't really
talk to women about P Wait, why is that? Because
if you tell an average woman about Pua, she will
get kind of pissed off and offended. Why is that
it's not for no reason, there is a good reason
behind it. Because actually, to the woman, what it looks
like you're doing is you're glorifying your narcissism. Not only
are you narcissistic, but you're not even taking up aims
to improve your narcissism, you're like taking up to the
next notch. Right? You're making narcissism acceptable. You're glorifying it.
And this is what why women get kind of pissed
off. It's the same as you would feel. Or maybe
you do feel this way already about feminism. It's like
feminism takes it one step too much to one side.
And pick up if you notice, it's actually kind of
like the mirror opposite. The polar opposite of feminism, it
takes it one step, maybe even two steps to the
opposite side. Just like one step too far, one a
little, just a little bit too far. Right? Not like
totally evil, but just like a little step towards evil,
like in that direction. You know what I'm talking about.
So there's a good reason why women would be pissed
off at you, because they see that, you know, hey,
I'm trusting you, as a follower, I want you to
be my leader, my man, you're gonna be my leader.
But then I discover that you actually don't give a
shit about my agenda. And all you're interested in is
yourself and glorifying your own ego. It's kind of like,
I feel like you're tricking me. You see, you see
if I wouldn't be put off by this. Imagine, here's
an analogy for you. Imagine that you discovered one day,
that there's a community of 1000s of women, hundreds of
1000 women who have come together on message boards, and
in various social circles, and layers around the country and
the world. And these women, their sole objective is to
find out how to marry a rich man as rich
as possible, and how to then divorce him and take
all his money. That would be kind of analogous to
what like the pickup community is about? It's kind of
like, how do we come together and learn every single
strategy and technique to get as many women to sleep
with us as possible. And avoid as much responsibility as
possible, and get everything we want. And give them nothing.
It's kind of like that. That's kind of what they
have. Now. I'm, I'm exaggerating this. I'm not saying that
everything you do with women is negative, and it goes
against their self agenda. But in general, you can't deny
that this is the direction which pickup community goes, right?
You as a guy, if you heard about these women
who conspire against men to steal all their money through
divorces, that you would get pissed off by this. You
would feel like it's manipulative. You would feel like it's
low consciousness behavior, you would feel like it's not very
honorable. It's not very honest. You would feel like it's,
it's coming from the wrong place. Like you would wonder
like, what is going through that woman's mind that she
would go so stoop so low, to just kind of
like do anything just for money? Well, in the same
sense, when a women when women look at you, they
kind of wonder what is wrong with these guys, that
they would stoop so low that they will do anything,
just to sleep with a hot girl? See, are you
starting to see the fuller perspective here? One of the
problems that I see with pickup is that it gives
you a, it gives you an it gives you a
certain perspective on life. And there's a certain truth to
that perspective, but also it's a very narrow perspective. It's
like you got to widen out your field of view.
And you can do that by taking into account other
people's and other cultures and other groups, points of view
and then integrating it with your own balancing it out.
Another big problem why mainstream society frowns upon pickup is
because it lacks integrity. And this is actually a problem
for you more than it is a problem for mainstream
society. Why does pickup lack integrity? Because fundamentally, it's dishonest
and manipulative? What pickup is basically is guys coming together
to learn all the best ways to manipulate women into
getting, giving them exactly what the guy wants. as efficiently
as possible. That's what pickup is, is that's what it
is. How do you manipulate women man in so many
ways, and in so many subtle ways, that it's quite
amazing that guys go to this length of manipulation for
sex. One common response that I hear from pickup guys,
it's like, well, no, Leo, you don't understand. I don't
manipulate women. I mean, yes, some pickup guys like old
school pickup, guys, they might have manipulated women like mystery
method that was clear manipulation of women. That's not what
we do these days. What we do these days is
we do like the authentic like, I'm becoming an authentic
man, and I'm just being myself. And then the women
just get attracted. And so it's not manipulation. That's, that's
just complete horseshit. You me literally the shit out of
women, you manipulate women, by the way that you dress,
by the way you talk, by the way you look
at them, by the way you smile, all of those
are calculated behaviors that you have trained in yourself, to
get exactly the kind of reaction result that you want
from the woman. Even your authenticity is a manipulation, you're
using authenticity as a manipulation to get what you want.
That's what you're doing. It's not real authenticity, you haven't
discovered yet what true authenticity is, it's much deeper, much,
much deeper than what you learned from even the best
forms, the highest quality forms of pickup, extremely manipulative. Everything
you do is a manipulation. From the moment you wake
up in the morning, and you stop planning your trip
to the club, already, you're manipulating, as you're walking into
the door of the club, already, you're manipulating already, in
subtle ways, you got to start to see the manipulation
is very, very subtle. And the pickup community generally denies
this, they deny that they manipulate women, which is of
course, completely ridiculous. The only way you could believe that
as if that you're, you're very, very unaware. Also, the
continuing on this point about lack of integrity, you break
the golden rule. You know what the golden rule is,
do unto others as you want them to do unto
you. So if you don't want others to steal from
you don't steal from them. sort of thing, right? But
pick up breaks this rule. Like I already said with
that analogy about women conspiring against men to to divorce
them and take all their money, right? If I treated
you, man's man, if I treated you in the same
manipulative way, that you treat a woman to get her
to sleep with you and to get attracted to you,
you would feel like I'm being dishonest with you. You
would be upset. And rightly so, because it breaks the
golden rule. You want me to treat you in a
certain respectful manner, which is absent in the way that
you treat women. For example, if I manipulated you try
to get you to buy something from me, for example,
through my marketing, in the same degree that you manipulate
women, and you found out about me doing that, then
you'd be upset with me. You would I guarantee that
you would, you would post some nasty comment about how
I'm evil and I'm greedy and all this kind of
stuff. Well, what the fuck do you think you're doing
with women? You're breaking the golden rule. I also find
that it's hard to trust P ways. Why do I
not really trust pu A's, both the professional ones and
the amateur ones. I don't trust them fundamentally, because they
break their own integrity. When a human being has the
kind of character structure and personality that allows him to
manipulate easily other people like women in the club, then
I know that actually that will bleed over into how
he lives the rest of his life. So when he's
doing business with me, I'm not going to trust that
fucking person. I would never fucking trust a Pua in
a business deal. Not to fuck me over. You see,
because the level of consciousness is the same level orange
consciousness will manipulate everything to itself to its own advantage,
damn the consequences to anybody else. So, for example, you
know, one thing that I'm always weary of, is, when
I see one of the professional P ways, you know,
advertising a new product or new course or something like
this, I can actually see that. Not only that, I
can kind of see flavors of the way that they
interact with women reflected in the way that they interact
and with their customers, I can actually see I can
see to their advertising style, I can see it in
the way that they try to convince you to get
involved with pickup, it's the same kind of manipulation, basically.
And again, it kind of breaks the golden rule, because
what happens to you, it leaves a sour taste in
your mouth. Also, lack of integrity is really proven and
demonstrated by the fact that most pickup guys do not
talk about pickup, or that they're in pickup with women
that they date, or that they're with. You hide it
from women, right? You don't talk honestly about what pickup
is and how it works, and why you do it
and all this kind of stuff. That's quite rare that
you would do that. What's funny is that I actually
did that with the girls that I talked to. And
I'm not saying I didn't do anything with it. I
did plenty manipulative shit in my pickup career, but also,
I would be sensitive to all of these things, right?
So I didn't go like full out evil on this
stuff. And if I was dating a girl, I would
actually tell her that I do pickup I would explain
why I do it. And this would oftentimes break the
girl's heart like she would, she would cry, she'd be
really upset. Like it would really hurt her emotionally. But
still, I felt like being honest about it is better
than hiding it, which is what most guys do. Most
guys hide it. And then of course, they manipulate themselves
into thinking that oh, no, like, I'm not hiding anything.
I'm not hiding. She doesn't need to know, why would
she need to know this? She would understand anyways, so
it's okay for me not to tell her. That's a
big pile of horseshit, big, big pile of horseshit right
there. If what you were doing is was fully aboveboard,
then you would have no problem communicating it to women.
So that's actually a good litmus test. How honest are
you about your full pickup career and your full pickup
activities when you're talking to women? Most guys are not.
Also, the pickup community is dishonest with itself. So a
lot of the points that I'm talking about here that
pickup unity completely denies, turns a blind blind eye to
sweeps under the rug, and prefers not to talk about
this. And in fact, what it has, it has very
nice stories, and rationalizations for why all these things I'm
talking about, either are not true, or they're, you know,
they're excused away or something like this. So that's a
fundamental lack of integrity in the community itself. And then
of course, that gets absorbed into all the individual members
of the community. And the last big problem with pickup
is that it limits your self actualization. The way this
happens is that it gives you a false sense of
happiness. When you're doing pickup, it's exciting. It's new, it's
adventurous, and you feel like you're really happy and thrilled,
the happiest you've been in your whole life when you're
having sex with all these girls and having fun in
the club and so forth and hanging out with your
friends. Actually, that's a that's a facade. That's not real.
That's not real happiness. That's not unconditional happiness. As soon
as those things are taken away from you, you're unsatisfied.
In fact, you're not even satisfied when you have those
things. A common situation with pickup guys that they get
really good, they bring a bunch of girls, and they
actually get depressed, they get depressed, because they got what
they wanted. And it still didn't change fundamentally who they
were or how happy they feel in life. They're still
miserable and depressed. So that's a huge trap. Also, the
reason it limits your self actualization is because it distracts
you from what's really meaningful. What's really meaningful is not
going to clubs and bars, and banging bunch of girls
and dressing cool. And talking shoot with your friends. That's
not what's meaningful about life. That's all really shallow shit.
And pick up sucks you into this community where it
makes you feel like all this stuff is really meaningful.
It really feels like when you're doing pickup properly, it's
like, man, it feels like I've my eyes have been
open to this whole new world. You know, I've seen
The Matrix and now I'm outside of the matrix and
and now there's so much meaning in my life. And
you know, I was playing World of Warcraft for 40
hours a week and now you know, I'm this I'm
this confident guy out there, you know, talking to girls
who have these cool hobbies and stuff. Look how meaningful
my life is. That's a facade. That's the facade. Not
really true. real meaning is a lot deeper in life.
Real meaning if you want that you have to go
more towards the spiritual side of things. Which pick up
doesn't do pickup is anti spiritual. And the other reason
that pickup limits your self actualization is because of the
groupthink and the dogma and the conformity within pickup. It's
really ironic because the pickup community likes to spout and
preach this notion of, you know, groupthink is bad. And
conformity is bad. We're anti conformist. We're so open minded,
but actually pick up people are some of the most
closed minded and dogmatic people that I know. And it's,
it's funny, it's almost like, you know, that kid in
high school, who went and got a pierced ear, or
a tattoo or something, just because he wanted to be
different and nonconformist. But in an ironic way, by doing
that, he now actually became even like more of a
conformist because all the kids that got a tattoo or
got it pierced ear within like hanging out together. And
they would think that they're like being anti establishment and
non conformance when actually they were being the definition of
conformity. They were just doing that out of conformity. That's
kind of what pickup is like. It's a it's a
low consciousness reaction against some of the bad stuff in
mainstream society, some of the stuff that limits you in
mainstream society. It's like a swing of your pendulum from
one end to the next end, and not being able
to find the balance in between. Also, I find the
community in general is very immature and juvenile. Just the
way that pickup pickup people talk. There's just kind of
like, Bro mentality. Have you noticed this kind of like,
Bro vibe, to the way they talk? It's kind of
like, you know, guys in the locker room kind of
talk or guys in the frat house kind of talk.
And it gets really old really quickly. I also find
is that the community has this kind of one sided
perspective on life. It's this highly male dominated perspective. It's
like, what is the male's agenda? Fuck everything else. Let's
just amplify the males agenda to the nth degree kind
of thing. Fuck the ecosystem, folks, society, fuck women Fuck
everything else, just the male perspective. So in this sense
is why says the mere opposite of feminism. And just
think about how much when you think about feminism, you're
kind of disgusted by feminism or like men feminism, like
what are they thinking? What's the same thing with pickup?
Like, what are you thinking it's such a narrow minded
perspective on life. When you actually start to interact with
more people, listen to them. People from different cultures and
different genders and different ages, you start to get a
much broader perspective on life. And the final problem I
have with the pickup community is it's really a support
group for narcissism. You realize that, that that's what it
is. narcissism and selfishness is actually frowned upon by society.
To make it acceptable, and to make it a tool
that you can use to have lots of sex, what
you need to do is you need to create an
ecosystem or a bubble, within which there's now an acceptance
of narcissism and narcissism is now glorified. And it's told
to you that, hey, it's cool. It's okay, you can
do it. That's what the pickup community is for. That's
why the pickup community is so tight knit, it's not
an accident. Because if you had to go do some
of the shit that you do with pickup, all on
your own, without any social support, it would be almost
impossible. Because it would be so jarring for your mind,
because it's so antithetical to mainstream society and kind of
mainstream decency. Right. It's really funny how that is like
this. This bubble is like, you almost need to create
your own private little dimension or world within which then
you can do some of the crazy shit that you
do with pickup. Because it is anti spiritual. And because
it does break integrity, and that because it does disrespect
women. And because it does limit your self actualization. These
are the core reasons, valid reasons why mainstream society frowns
upon pickup. And these are not just reasons, from society's
point of view that you should be concerned about. These
really should be concerned about from your own self First
agenda. Because these are all the things that you need
to develop in yourself, you need more integrity. If you
want to grow yourself, you need to open yourself to
more self actualization potential. If you want to grow yourself,
you need to start to respect women more, if you
want to really have high quality relationships with them. And
you need to take on spiritual values, if you want
to really be fulfilled in life. So as the Buddha
says, you know, you don't get punished for your anger,
you get punished by your anger. In the same way,
I'm not saying that someone's going to punish you for
doing pickup. I'm saying you're getting punished already by the
fact that you're doing pickup. The question is, Will You
Be wise enough to recognize that? Or will you be
in denial? Speaking of denial, let me address some of
the common P way defenses that come up. When I
bring up some of these points. One defense goes like
this, Leo, you've just been socially conditioned, you don't understand
you're stuck in a social matrix, we have broken out
of the social matrix. This is funny. I know I've
not just been socially conditioned, I'm actually very anti social
conditioning myself, right? But across the board, including the pickup
conditioning, what do you think pickup is pickup is social
conditioning? Right? It's just a different flavor of it. Be
more mindful of how pickup conditions you? It does. It's
got very strong groupthink going on inside of it. Remember,
I'm not talking about this as an outsider, I've been
where you are, I've seen what pickup really is I've
done it myself, all these things that might seem like
I'm here, pointing my finger at you and kind of
judging you. Actually, I've done all this stuff, right. That's
how I can speak about it. So kind of boldly.
Because I've done it. I've seen the results that gets,
there's some good stuff about it. There's some passive about
it. There's a gray area there. It's not all black
and white. Right. But fundamentally, what I had to do
is I had to kind of outgrow it. And I
had to I had to see the limitations of it.
Which is not to say that I've fully outgrown it.
And it's not to say that I'll never talk to
girls again. I'll get to that point as we go
on. Let's tackle another defense which is, but Leo No,
you don't understand. We're actually self actualizing and reducing our
ego as we do pick up. And this is total
horseshit. Yes, there's some elements of personal development within pickup.
And those are great. And that's actually why I got
involved so heavy into pickup in the first place, I
was more attracted to the personal development elements than I
was to the girls. This point about reducing your ego,
I hear a lot of talk about this in the
pickup circles. And this is just total shit. Pickup guys
have huge egos. They don't have small egos. And what
they do is they they don't really understand what the
ego is. Yes, in a sense, there are certain aspects
of your ego that you do have to break down.
Because you're doing something very challenging with pickup, you're really
pushing your comfort zone and that kind of does change
you. But in a kind of twisted way. What it
does is it has to actually build up your ego
even more. Because now you think you're the shit. And
now you think you're right now you think you're better
than everyone else and so on and so forth. And
you know, for all the lip service that Pua guys
pay to Eckhart Tolle, in reading the Power of Now
that book, they have no fucking idea what Eckhart Tolle
is talking about the values that Eckhart Tolle is expressing
or completely antithetical to pick up. Eckhart Tolle is not
out there talking to girls and making girls you realize
this, right? You realize that Eckart Tolle is enlightened. This
shit that you're doing that you think is going to
make you fulfilled to him? This is a fucking joke.
It's a joke. It's too fucking delusion. It's delusion. What
you're doing is a distraction. From enlightenment work. total distraction.
That's all pickup is distraction from enlightenment. You could think
of it that way. So this, this whole bucket argument
that you're actually reducing your ego when you do pick
up is is the biggest self deception that there is.
No common defense is that hey, Leo, you know, we're
not actually manipulating women. I don't manipulate women. I don't
know about other people. But you know, when I do
pick up Leo, I don't manipulate women. I'm just being
honest and authentic and cool. And groats want to have
sex with me and sleep with me. And that's just
you know, my authentic style. That's horseshit. That is such
horseshit. What you've done is you've become so good at
manipulating women that you've internalized those things, and now you're
just on autopilot. Now just because you can money To
delete women on autopilot does not mean that you're authentic
and does not mean that you're not manipulating women. You
got to be a lot more self honest on this
point. Another common defense is like this. Hey, Leah. Look,
women love sex. You understand women love sex. You're talking
about this whole thing as though like, I'm doing something
wrong to him by having sex with them. But no
women, I'm giving them a gift by having sex with
them. That's funny. It's true that women do love sex.
And it's true that sometimes when you have sex with
a woman, it's kind of like you're giving her you
know, a nice gift. But that's not what is really
driving you with picket. You're not here to be altruistic
towards with, let's be honest. Just because a woman likes
sex does not excuse your manipulative, dishonest and low integrity
behaviors. Right? Check yourself on that one. Another common defenses
but Leo, women are sluts and whores. Women use men,
women cheat, you don't understand you don't see all the
nasty stuff that women do. Maybe women do some nasty
stuff. Women are human beings after all. And we all
do nasty stuff once in a while because we are
human. And we're not perfect. But this does not excuse
your attitude towards women. Also, furthermore, I would point out
that a lot of the stereotypes you have of women
being sloths and horrors and using men and cheating a
lot. These are simply false. So actually, one of the
really damaging stereotypes that I see pickup guys developing is
that women alike will cheat on you on the drop
of a dime. I find that really untrue. In practice,
I find that women are actually quite loyal. I'm, I'm
always shocked at how loyal women are. With me personally,
most women are very loyal. If you treat them well.
And you're a strong confident guy, the odds of her
cheating on you are quite low. Usually what this is,
is this is actually a low self esteem issue that
pickup guys have is they think, because they are so
quick to cheat on women. And because they are, you
know, out there in bars and clubs all the time,
this gives them a warped perspective on how women actually
behave. The average woman is not like that is simply
false. And this will damage your ability to be in
a relationship with a high quality woman for long. Another
common excuse that pickup guys have is they say but
Leo, women are emotionally crazy. You don't even need to
reason with women. You can't reason with women. They're not
logical. They do all this emotionally crazy stuff. So who
even cares about their emotions? You know, they're suffering internally
all the time anyways. So what collateral damage am I
doing? You know, I'm not doing anything worse than then
they're doing themselves. It's true that a lot of young
women are emotionally unstable. However, what you're doing is you're
kind of preying on that instability, which is what I
would define as an anti spiritual value, and lack of
integrity on your car. So just because you see a
baby with a candy bar, and you can take the
candy bar easily, does not mean you should, right. And
just because the baby's already crying, and taking the candy
bar, we're just you No, not really increased crying any
more than already is doesn't mean that it's the right
thing to do. Another defense that I hear is something
like Billy Oh, you know, I'm a natural born player.
I'm happy being a player. Maybe some guys like maybe
you Leo. Maybe you're just kind of like cut out
to be the nice guy. And then some of us
are like cut out to be the kind of like
natural born suave players. And so it's just kinda like
my personality type. And so it makes me happy it
maybe doesn't make you happy, Leo, but it makes me
happy. This is a fucking lie. Straight up bullshit lie.
You know, you I'm not denying that you have a
certain personality type that might be different than mine. That's
fine. But what I'm going to tell you is that
if you understand psychology at a deep enough level, and
you've studied as much of it as I have, then
you understand that it's not possible for you to be
happy living the playa lifestyle. It is not humanly possible
to be happy that way. It will not work. Feel
free to test it out. Many of you probably already
have. And you've seen the consequences. The other common defense
is Hey, Leah, you're just jealous, bro. You're jealous if
you had my mad pickup skills. You know, you're probably
the kind of guy who did some pickup and you
slept with a few girls but you didn't bang the
really hot girls. You didn't really get that good. So
now you're just jealous. And now you're talking about all
this bad stuff, because you had some bad experience with
pickup. Actually, no, I had some of the best experiences
of my life with pickup, I had a lot of
fun. I mean, I had a lot of tough times,
but I had a lot of fun in general, I
made great friends, I met amazing girls. I've had amazing
experiences, you know, it opened my eyes a lot, I
learned a lot, it was amazing. And I will admit
that I'm not the best player, I can't just go
in and you know, pick up a 10 on the
drop of a dime or something like that. I'm not
really that good. I would need to practice a lot
more to get that good. But this idea that I'm
jealous of your, you know, your mad player skills, would
I like my skills to be better? Sure, I would
like to be more attractive with girls and, you know,
be more humorous and stuff. And I'm still working on
some of those skills. But this, this does not defend
against all the points that I've made, right? I've made
much deeper points here, that go way beyond jealousy. Just
because you can bang lots of girls and get a
bunch of success does not fix the materialism problem. In
the same sense that, you know, if you have billions
of dollars, those billions of dollars just because you have
more billions than somebody else does not make you happier.
It doesn't fix the fundamental root problem in that money
never makes you happy. And the last defense that you
might have is they might say something like Well, duh,
Leo. You were doing the wrong kind of pickup. I
don't know what kind of pickup you are doing. You're
probably doing some mystery method bullshit, you know, something? Like
from the 90s I'm doing the new kind of, you
know, 21st century pickup the authentic pickup. I don't use
any lines, Leo, you know, I don't tell bullshit stories.
I'm always honest. And I'm always spontaneous. I'm just having
fun with girls. yatta yatta yatta? No, actually, you know,
I didn't really do any mystery method shit. I studied
it, but I didn't really do much of it. I've
been practicing like, the cutting edge, authentic style pickup. The
kind of pickup that works mostly on your inner game,
right? It tells you to be authentic, and, and so
forth. And I've studied lots of different pickup instructors and
theories. So it wasn't just like one rotten apple that
I studied or some one manipulative technique that I use,
like some hypnosis shit, I didn't even touch that stuff.
I'm just talking about your normal, authentic style pickup. Even
that stuff. Everything I said applies to even that. So
those were the common defenses. At this point, you might
be wondering, okay, Leo, I mean, you're really pushing strong
here. What do you want me to do? You want
me to quit pickup? Is that what you're telling us
to do? And here's where you got to be careful.
Because my objective with this episode is not to vilify
pickup, and to tell you to quit pick up and
never talk to girls again, and become a monk. That's
not what I'm trying to get you to do here.
I'm trying to get you to be more aware of
what you're doing in your life, I'm trying to get
you to be more conscious of what the pickup community
is about. And some of the limitations of it. I'm
not saying that everything that we have here is wrong
and bad and unhealthy. There are some very healthy and
good intentioned goals within the pickup community. But there's also
a lot of limits. I focused on covering the limits,
because that's what I wanted to focus on. Let me
really stress the following point is that there's nothing wrong
with approaching a girl and speaking to her flirting with
her and having sex with her. There's nothing wrong with
that. The key is in how you do it and
why you do it. That's the key. What are your
motivations? Why are you involved in pickup in the first
place? What do you think is gonna happen? What do
you hope to accomplish? What are your intentions towards this
girl? Is your intention to make her part of your
harem? Is that your intention? Or is your intention to
actually start a, like a genuine relationship with this individual?
All those things matter. Also, you know, talking about speaking
about quitting pickup, let me just remind you that you
will quit pickup anyways. You will outgrow it at some
point. How long will it take? Maybe a year? Maybe
three? Maybe five? maybe 10, maybe 20 years? I don't
know. But most of you will outgrow it and probably
a lot faster than you think. Probably within three years
you will outgrow pickup. Because you will move on, you'll
start to see broader perspectives in life. Right? So this
whole idea of like, Should you quit pickup now, you
know, if you're involved in pickup and you feel like
it's something you got to do, go do it. But
do it in a more responsible way. Do it understanding
that it's just one step in your journey to go
higher, and don't claim to this step. Look towards the
next step, stage green. And most importantly, I want you
to watch yourself, when you're doing pickup in how you're
using pickup to go on colleges, because this is what
you're doing. Notice that you're distracting yourself with pickup, you're
distracting yourself from the important work that you really gotta
be doing in life. And I don't just mean your
nine to five job. I mean, many other things, most
importantly, self actualization, and spiritual work. I want you to
notice, as you're doing pickup that sex does not equal
fulfillment. Not at all. I want you to also notice
the dogma within the pickup community. As you're browsing the
message boards, and you're talking to your friends, I want
you to also be much more mindful of the collateral
damage that you cause to women, when you interact with
them. Set a higher standard for yourself, develop more empathy,
and more compassion towards women seek to understand the world
from their eyes a little bit more, rather than from
the eyes of your friends and other pickup buddies. This
is what I want you to do. Is see this
is subtle. I'm not necessarily telling you to go quick
pickup and never talk to girls again. In fact, me
personally, I intend to talk to girls throughout my life.
And I'll probably go to clubs and bars and I'll
chat up many girls in the future, right? That's fine.
But the place that I'm going to do it from
is going to be very different than the place that
I used to do it from. And the place that
I'm going to do it from is going to be
very different from the way that the pickup community, preachers
us to do it. The good news here is that
there are even better ways to do personal development than
through pickup. I know one of the fears I had
when I was leaving pickup was that like, it's like,
damn, I was learning so much. And I was growing
so fast when I was, you know, hitting the clubs.
And now that I'm not doing that, that means my
growth is gonna stop, how am I gonna keep growing?
I'm gonna keep asking actualizing. But what I was shocked
and surprised, pleasantly to discover is that there are many
modes through which to do self improvement work. There's meditation,
there's journaling, there's going to seminars, going to workshops, there's
doing enlightenment work, self observation work. There's reading books, there's
doing exercises and books, there's listening to audio, but there's
like so much stuff you could do. Working on your
business, building a high quality relationship with that one girl
that you really like building really high quality friendships, all
this kind of stuff is still on the table for
you if you want. So you're not really losing anything.
That's it. That's all I have to say. Basically, in
