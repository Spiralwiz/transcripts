how do psychedelics work that's what we'll be answering in
this episode I've really intended this episode to be for
those people who have tried a psychedelic once or twice
experienced something crazy had no idea what happened it blindsided
you and maybe now you're scared of trying it again
or maybe now you're researching to find out like what
happened to me how do I explain what happened so
if you care about explaining what happened then this is
the episode for you I'm gonna explain all of the
mechanics and metaphysics and the epistemology of psychedelics which I've
been studying for several years now in a lot of
depth and my background in this really it started with
just existential and metaphysical contemplation epistemic contemplation which I've been
doing for four decades basically since my teens without ever
doing any psychedelics and then about three or four years
ago I got into psychedelics and started experimenting with them
and because I was already into non-duality and spirituality and
philosophy and science and studying the foundations of science like
it it really got me interested in how do I
square what I'm experiencing in my psychedelic trips with mainstream
science and our ordinary understanding of reality cuz it's so
odd and so weird and so jarring some of the
stuff that you can experience the psychedelic trips and I
don't really see anybody explaining it anywhere I had to
figure it out for myself I don't see anybody explaining
it how it actually works so that's what you're gonna
get here so let's get into that just for reference
if you're curious I've done about 80 trips at this
point various kinds of psychedelics I've done mushrooms I've done
LSD I've done 2cb I've done five Mao DMT I've
done DBT I've done four ACO DMT and many others
that most humans don't even know about I've done psychedelics
that there are no trip reports written about completely new
substances which I'll be talking about in the future so
stick with me for that but so I have quite
a diversity of experiences and one of the biggest tricks
with psychedelics one of the biggest problems is that people
talk about psychedelics or try to understand psychedelics without having
enough direct experience with them and also not having enough
diversity in different substances because they can be quite different
even though they're all basically taking the same place in
different ways but it really helps to explore the entire
field the entire territory to start to wrap your mind
around what's really going on and I would say it
takes about 50 trips at least 50 trips to start
to understand what psychedelics are really about and that's one
of the biggest problems that I see in the entire
field of both science and in psychedelics and also in
the spiritual community is that people just don't appreciate how
deep this territory is how broad it is how much
material there is here and they say silly things like
oh yeah I did some psychedelics back in high school
a couple of times with my friends I got it
I got the message so you know as Alan Watts
used to say you know once you hear the message
you hang up the phone no no no no no
no your first few trips that that's that's not even
a beginning yet those are like the first few words
of the introduction so humble yourself really open your mind
and if you're serious about understanding what psychedelics are from
a sort of a scientific perspective which is where I'm
coming at it from then you got to be really
willing to put your own balls on the chopping block
and to really become a guinea pig and do this
do you really want to understand if you want to
really understand you ain't gonna understand it by reading books
or really even listening to me although I'll help you
hear this this this episode will be potentially life transforming
for you because it will show you how to work
with psychedelics and the full power of psychedelics which is
little known to many people even those who have tried
it a few times really cuz you got it you
gotta really get deep in it you gotta get 50
trips deep into it to really start to understand what
the hell is going on here so this is one
of the most powerful tools that you will find for
spiritual growth and for personal development hands down I've I've
tried so many different techniques meditation techniques self inquiry techniques
and other things and traditional self-help and psychology techniques and
NLP type stuff like nothing compares to what a psychedelic
can do for you nothing not even a a 30
day meditation retreat which is pretty hardcore most of you
guys are not going to be disciplined enough to do
30 days of non-stop meditation that's that's very rare stuff
but even that will not get you to the levels
of insight into the nature of reality that a psychedelic
can take you to so anyways that's the preamble now
let's get into explaining how does psychedelics actually work well
here we have to get very metaphysical and we have
to really challenge the materialistic paradigm that mainstream science is
operating under which is basically undergirding ient our culture as
a culture as a species we have to explain somehow
to ourselves how it is that we're here what it
is that we're doing here and how it is that
this thing we call reality works and so the biggest
challenge was psychedelics is that you can't use that paradigm
that we have used conventionally throughout our whole life I
call this the materialistic paradigm the paradigm of that there
are molecules and atoms bouncing around that make up the
universe and the universe is 14 billion years old and
we're living on a planet here and were Homo sapiens
that evolved over billions did this whole paradigm this scientific
materialistic paradigm of an objective external reality which existed before
you were even born and will continue to exist after
you die this whole thing you cannot understand what psychedelics
truly are as long as you're coming at it from
that paradigm because if you think that you're gonna take
this chemical put it in your mouth digest it the
chemicals are gonna rush up into your brain and do
stuff change some neurons and neurotransmitters are happening in there
and then you start to hallucinate things that aren't real
this is the mainstream explanation of what a psychedelic is
from that point of view yes I can Alex they
don't make sense but if you do suck it outs
with a very open mind deeply enough long enough you'll
realize that that entire paradigm will crumble that's not how
reality works that's not what reality is so here's how
to properly explain what psychedelics are there is no objective
external material reality and there never was ever there is
only mind or we could call it consciousness everything that
we think of as material physical external objective stuff the
stuff that science measures tables chairs walls buildings bodies this
all this that you see this around you everything you're
feeling and experiencing all this material stuff this is mind
this is universal mind the universe is a giant mind
which is imagining everything including everything material so atoms are
imaginary imagined by mind walls bricks buildings cars the earth
is imagined by mind that's the paradigm you got to
be coming from this not a Dogma that I suggest
that you hold as an ideology this is just something
that I'm telling you you will discover for yourself if
you go into these psychedelic experiences with an open mind
and you really want to get to the bottom of
what reality is eventually you'll discover what I'm telling you
but it'll be difficult for you to discover this because
the things that I'm telling you are shocking and it
takes an extremely open mind to to accept some of
these things that I'm saying many of these things that
I'm saying are scary frightening destabilizing to your sense of
reality in your sense of self okay so the problem
with the psychedelic is that it takes you so deep
into the nature of what reality is that distinction between
an external reality and your own self and your own
life this collapses and so unlike traditional science where you
can just be at a distance and you can just
sit over here with your telescope and look over there
far away and observe some distant star or galaxy or
whatever and take notes on it carefully and you can
just kind of separate yourself from what's over there this
process completely breaks down with psychedelics precisely because what the
psychedelic reveals to you is that the entire time that
we've been doing what we call science traditional science really
what that was is really we were exploring our own
minds and the real breakthrough moment in a psychedelic trip
is when you realize that there is no difference between
a psychedelic trip and ordinary life what we call material
life you are hallucinating right now everything is a hallucination
it's not that you take a chemical and then this
chemical does something to your brain to cause the brain
to hallucinate imaginary stuff that isn't real and then you
come back down to your sober state and here it
is here's the truth here's ordinary reality right now in
the sober state this is wrong that's not what's really
going on what's really going on is that you're hallucinating
right now all of us are and there is no
reality aside from hallucination a hallucination technically the definition of
what a hallucination is I use this term as a
technical term it's a very precise term I'm not using
it metaphorically I'm using it literally and precisely what a
hallucination is is its appearance without substance appearance without substance
and that's exactly what this is pure appearance without substance
it feels real doesn't it it feels solid it feels
tangible you can't just walk through a brick wall right
because that's precisely what's being hallucinate 'add what's being hallucinating
is a tangible material objective reality and by that being
hallucinating that is what is here and since there's nothing
but that there's nothing to contrast that against therefore your
hallucination becomes reality and there's nothing behind it there's nothing
behind the scenes causing it there's no brain which is
being altered to create this hallucination the biggest misconception that
scientifically minded people and rationally minded people and skeptically minded
people have about psychedelics is that they think like all
well Leo so yeah you you take some chemicals of
course a chemical will alter your brain chemistry and then
of course all sorts of way you can see all
sorts of wacky things of course yeah and so yeah
why would any of that be truthful how would you
be able to trust any of those and all sorts
of things like that but you're misunderstood you're misunderstanding that
you're in a hallucination right now if you're in a
hallucination right now means the brain that you are trying
to ground reality into right no such thing so there
will come a point in your trippin journey where you
trip long enough deep enough that you realize that there
never was a brain your brain is a hallucination so
even though it seems like and here's where reality gets
really twisted and strange loopy it seems like you're taking
a chemical and you're putting it into the body and
then that's affecting the brain of course these appearances are
here there's an appearance of a chemical there's appearance of
a body there's appearance of a brain if you cut
the brain open you'll see some neurons and stuff in
there I'm not denying that but all of that is
appearance hallucination all we have to do is change what's
in your consciousness and that will go away it will
no longer be true see so it's not that you're
taking a chemical really what the chemical is the psychedelic
it's a chemical but what is it really it's consciousness
you're taking consciousness you're putting it into the body which
is also consciousness and it's affecting consciousness so consciousness is
affecting consciousness that's exactly right because there's nothing but consciousness
when a rock falls on the table it makes a
loud sound that's consciousness affecting consciousness creating consciousness so the
rock is consciousness it hits the table which is consciousness
and the sound it creates is consciousness see so there's
nothing surprising about this this is how all of reality
works everything is consciousness interacting with itself and psychedelics are
no different so you might wonder that well so what
is so special about these chemicals that we can take
these particular chemicals and they cause wacky hallucinations well the
thing is that consciousness or infinite mind we are inside
of a giant universal infinite mind which can dream up
anything literally it has unlimited power to imagine anything right
now it happens to imagining this human sitting here speaking
to that human over there that's what its imagining in
the next second it can imagine something else usually it
doesn't because for the purposes of your survival consciousness needs
to be very rigid and consents consistent because otherwise literally
what would happen is you would start to think that
you're losing your mind imagine if you woke up tomorrow
and there was a pink giant elephant sitting in the
corner of your room you would think you've lost your
mind imagine if you walk outside and the and the
sky flickers usually it's blue but now it changes to
green orange black white pink purple and it does this
50 times a second you would think you're having some
sort of disorder you think you're having you're having a
seizure or something if this was happening to you you'd
be terrified you would probably go and check yourself into
a mental hospital but here's the mistake is to think
like well okay yeah well if that was happening then
yeah that is something's going wrong in my brain and
that's a mental disorder I got to go to the
hospital to fix that no no no that is the
mistake the mistake is to think that the truth is
is that consciousness can be in an infinite number of
different ways it can imagine all sorts of different things
some of them can seem sane some of them can
seem crazy or insane but these boundaries of sane and
insane these are completely arbitrary what you call saying is
simply that which you're very comfortable and familiar with and
what you call insane is simply those things which are
radically completely out of the norm for you so you
have to really understand psychedelics you have to go into
it with an extremely open mind and be really willing
to change your entire paradigm of reality because one of
two things will happen either the psychedelic you do enough
of them that they will force you to change your
notions of what reality is throwing away all of the
stuff that you learned in school and from your parents
and so forth all the stuff that science has taught
you you have to throw all that away either you
do that or and this is what happens to most
people is that before you even approach that point you
will say to hell with this screw this this is
some crazy wacky [ __ ] I want nothing to
do with it and you'll stop and usually what will
do it is just fear you'll be too afraid to
go deep enough to really get to the point where
you can understand what psychedelics are and the reason that
is and the reason psychedelics are such a taboo topic
and the reason they're so poorly understood by scientists and
even by many spiritual teachers and gurus and mystics very
poorly understood is because they're so threatening to one's sense
of self and reality even some enlightened guru if he
takes enough psychedelics I can pretty much guarantee that many
of his beliefs and ideas about Awakening and spirituality will
be shattered by the psychedelic because it's so radical and
there's really no end to it not that I've discovered
yet you can keep upping your doses more and more
and more and see what happens is that the psychedelic
what it does is it changes the ordinary rigid flow
of consciousness so if we think of just your entire
life the way that it goes you know like every
morning you wake up then you brush your teeth you
go to work then you come back home you eat
your [ __ ] you sleep and so on and
then you do that same thing the next day and
you're kind of in a physical 3d reality that we
know of and you interact with your friends and families
all the people that you know you go to the
stores that you know and all that stuff you're in
house that you are familiar with and all that stuff
you're in the 21st century all of that is highly
fluid and completely arbitrary and changeable in the snap of
a finger the only problem is that you've never actually
had it happen to you psychedelics will change that for
you in an instant if you take enough of them
but the problem will be can you handle it see
can you handle that cuz that that's very shocking when
your reality starts melting around you and what's even worse
about it is not just that you take a chemical
and in reality starts melting around you no no it's
way worse than that the real scary part about it
is that you realize that oh that life that I
used to live where I used to wake up in
a house and go to the store and go to
work and talk to my family and friends and blah
blah blah and I was living in 21st century all
of that that was just a trip all of that
was a hallucination it was just an alternative hallucination it
was a very rigid loose nation and now I finally
for the first time in my life I've broken out
of it that's what we call the breakthrough experience if
you ever get that a breakthrough experience with psychedelics is
an experience that's so radical that it completely recontextualizes your
prior experience of life as you knew it and it
basically shows you that that thing that you thought was
life you were born you went to school you got
married you had children that's all gone it's all imaginary
you're in a new reality now something totally new has
happened to you and it's completely shocking and baffling especially
because you're trying to come into it understanding it using
a sort of scientific materials paradigm where you're thinking like
well but I thought there was like a earth and
I thought there was a universe there was galaxies and
I thought they were like humans and people and we
were living in the 21st century and I thought my
parents were this way my my children were like this
and I thought my body was like this and now
all the sudden all that stuff is gone and now
you have to refigure out what reality is and that's
extremely threatening and scary which is why people are so
negative about psychedelics there's such a big stigma about it
every time I talk about how to get a bunch
of [ __ ] people you know giving me a
bunch of [ __ ] for it and the reason
that happens is simply because that's a defense mechanism of
the ego mind that's all that that is so as
I was saying your whole life has been consciousness just
flowing taking different shapes and forms right now it's taking
this particular shape and form and it's still flowing because
look sounds are coming out of this mouth talking to
you you're hearing it you're understanding it stuff is happening
around you this is the flow of consciousness this is
a hallucination but it's a very specific type of hallucination
now what we can do is we can alter what
this stream of consciousness is showing to you imagine you
know you've seen maybe in sort of a behind the
scenes documentaries and such where they go to these sound
recording booths for professional sound recording and you look at
this kind of mix board where they have literally hundreds
maybe even a thousand different knobs knobs you can twist
and turn and rotate and pull up and down and
they adjust all the different aspects of the music and
the recordings that are being made so imagine that that's
what consciousness is like imagine that consciousness is like an
it's a completely free field is sort of like a
three dimensional or even more than that multi-dimensional screen kind
of a computer screen but imagine a computer screen that
has an infinite number of dimensions not - and it
has an infinite number of properties they can take colors
sounds smells imagine a screen like this that is consciousness
and this screen has absolutely no limits it can display
or render anything that you can imagine and even more
right now it happens to be rendering and displaying what's
right here what we can do though is imagine that
to this screen runs a giant wire and this wire
hooks up to this giant mixing board with hundreds of
knobs and each one of these knobs can be tuned
and adjusted fine-tuned to change what is being displayed it's
like if you twist this knob here the colors will
become more vivid you twist this knob here the colors
will dim you twist this knob here the sounds will
go wonky they'll become louder or softer you twist this
knob here and you'll feel emotion you'll feel love or
anger or hatred or jealousy or sadness you twist this
knob over here and your body morphs your hand will
morph into a tentacle you twist a little bit more
it turns into a claw you twist a little bit
more it turns into a wing you twist a little
more turns into something else and you can twist all
of these and all of these knobs control everything that's
being rendered and displayed on this screen called consciousness but
then there's one master knob it's a giant knob right
at the center of the whole console and if you
turn this knob this is the knob that we're gonna
call pure consciousness awareness itself it's not any particular quality
of consciousness so turning this knob will not change any
colors it will not change the sounds it will not
change the feelings and emotions that you feel nothing like
that will change that's the content of consciousness the content
will not change but by twisting this knob we are
simply going to increase consciousness now of course the question
is what is consciousness well I have episodes about that
you can go search for those if you want a
very detailed answer that's very specific here I'll just say
that consciousness is simply your ability to be aware of
everything within the field of consciousness all the colors all
the sounds all the feelings everything all the possible objects
so by cranking this up we're just making you hyper
alert like super super super alert think of it as
the difference like when you're really really sleepy the knob
is almost all the way off if you were totally
asleep dead asleep the knob would be let's say at
zero but if you're awake but you're so sleepy that
you can barely keep your eyes open the knob is
you know it's a little bit on now if we
keep twisting towards this direction a little bit more we
twist it and we get to a point where we
have ordinary current waking conscious what we call ordinary life
as you're aware right now then we can twist it
even more to a point where we might get to
where you might be if you did 10 days of
the posada meditation imagine that you meditate for 10 days
straight if you've actually ever done that hopefully you have
to get a reference point for what I'm talking about
then you you you're in a state of consciousness where
you're hyper aware of everything you're extremely sensitive you're more
conscious than normal waking consciousness or if you've taken for
example a nootropic like provigil or modafinil or are modafinil
that will roughly put you to where you might be
after a nice 10 day meditation retreat you're very very
awake almost like hyper caffeinated but also calm not not
super you know hyper and jittery but that's just the
beginning of what this knob can do this is sort
of the normal range that most people have ever experienced
in their life but this knob can keep being twisted
and twisted and twisted and it has no end the
knob twists forever in this direction you can keep twisting
it more and more and more and more towards more
and more and more consciousness eventually if you twist this
knob enough you will become so conscious that you're conscious
of the entire universe try to imagine this as a
possibility open your mind to this possibility that if we
twist this knob enough we twisted a hundred times over
itself you will become so conscious that you're conscious of
the entire universe you have literal omniscience and then of
course there's a bunch of gradations before that so before
we get to that you can become conscious of a
lot of different stuff before you get to UM nisshin's
so the most important thing so here's how psychedelics are
it the most important thing that a psychedelic does is
that it it twists this major knob the main knob
of consciousness it makes you a lot more conscious of
everything in your visual field and auditory field and in
your physical body it makes you orders of magnitude more
conscious than you would be from a meditation retreat even
if you meditated for thirty days straight you'll be more
conscious than that and that's on a moderate dose of
psychedelics if you take a high dose of psychedelics you
can be orders of magnitude more conscious than even that
these are levels of consciousness which are so conscious that
is terrifying it's frightening it's completely beyond human consciousness you're
not a human anymore at this point you go into
what's called what I call God consciousness God consciousness because
you become Universal and you become literally omniscient as amazing
as that sounds but see what complicates the situation is
that the psychedelic doesn't just twist this consciousness knob and
leave everything else the same because if we only twist
this knob this room would still be here all the
colors and sounds would be exactly as they are but
every psychedelic twists a bunch of different knobs it has
a unique sort of character profiles so almost no psychedelic
only twists the consciousness knob they all twist the conscious
knob to some degree some more than others but then
they also twist a lot of minor knobs which start
to mess around with stuff like colors sounds feelings textures
thoughts emotions objects all sorts of weird stuff can start
happening so here's the trick with understanding psychedelics this is
the key is that when it starts to come on
your visual field most prominently will start to morph and
it start to wave and melt the higher the dose
the more it will morph and melt because what you're
literally doing these are sort of disrupting the ordinary flow
of consciousness think of consciousness like a river imagine is
sort of us like a small stream actually for this
metaphor and you now take a giant boulder or a
log and you throw it in the middle of this
small stream it's gonna start to divert the water and
the water is gonna flow in a different pattern than
it normally does so that's sort of pretty much what
you're doing when you're taking this chemical you're interrupting the
ordinary hallucination that you're having your whole life the thing
you call your life that's a hallucination you're interrupting that
and you're changing it so of course colors can change
emotions feelings can change objects can change and so forth
and the sky is the limit just like with a
little stream you know if you if you get some
giant boulders and logs you can block up the entire
stream and you can divert all that water to flow
in a totally different direction something radically different than what
you traditionally call your life this will depend on the
dose and the method by which you take the psychedelic
and the kind of psychedelic you take and so forth
and every psychedelic will be different you know if you
throw a log into the river that will divert the
river in a slightly different way than if you throw
a stone versus if you throw you know some sand
in there or whatever and so those different objects are
like the different types of psychedelics like LSD or mushrooms
or DMT 580 mio or whatever see so here's the
problem is that because ordinarily people are not trained for
pure consciousness you're only really trained to be able to
recognize pure consciousness this central dial if you do a
lot of meditation but since most people are very poor
meditators they're not technically proficient meditators so they don't have
enough experience with this so when they take a psychedelic
you know like a high school kid takes a psychedelic
the first thing you notice is that all the colors
start to go wavy and crazy and you start to
look at a wall you might see a face in
it this kind of stuff and yeah these are hallucinations
that's because the psychedelic is twisting these minor knobs and
your attention gets distracted to the minor stuff to the
colors and sounds that are changing you might listen to
some eunuch you music and you might say oh wow
that's some beautiful music the music is especially beautiful on
the psychedelic I mean of course that's true that's because
the sort of the music dial has been tuned or
you might look at a tree and the tree looks
especially beautiful because the colors are so neon and vibrant
of course that's true because the neon color dial was
was tuned differently than it usually is and you might
look at the floor at the carpet and you might
see weird patterns in the carpet you didn't see before
league might see faces and dinosaurs and animals and demons
and whatever else and that's that's because that image recognition
dial of conscious has been tuned so you can now
see images and patterns that you aren't able to see
before and while that's happening you're being hypnotized and mesmerised
by this by this changing content of consciousness so much
that you can ignore sort of the meta thing that's
really going on which is that you're becoming more conscious
the central dial it has also been tuned and what's
really most important for our work here if you want
to understand what consciousness is and how psychedelics work is
you really got up focus your attention on this major
dial one of the common criticisms that I hear about
psychedelics even for many enlightened gurus and masters and mystics
and spiritual teachers is they will always throw out the
objection like oh well but enlightenment is not a state
and all you're doing with these psychedelics leo you're just
changing your state and it's just a temporary change then
you come back and I mean it's just a state
change big deal except this grossly oversimplify the problem and
and under appreciates really what psychedelics are when someone says
this they really it shows to their their lack of
experience with psychedelics because yes of course it's a state
change but everything is a state right now I'm in
a state you're in a state if you're awake if
you're sleepy that's a state you're in if you're asleep
then that's the state you're in if you're horny the
NASA state you're in if you're angry then that's the
state you're in if you're very meditative that NASA state
you're in there is nothing but states of consciousness consciousness
is all that there is now of course the trick
with the psychedelic the value of the psychedelic is not
merely that you get to change states of consciousness the
value of the psychedelic I would say is more of
a meta value it's the fact that you get to
watch consciousness as it changes its States in so doing
it's not that you're getting attached to some new state
so it's not that I'm sitting there and I'm looking
at the carpet and I'm seeing some face in the
carpet and I'm saying oh this face is the truth
or whatever no it's a meta thing that's happening what
you're actually doing is that your mind is able to
experience the new state and compare it to memories of
your old state compare the two and see like oh
so this is what is really going on this is
really how consciousness works so the value of the psychedelic
is that it shows you the fluidity of consciousness that's
one of the key values just the fact that you
get to change states and change into very radically different
states that's a huge eye-opening experience do not underestimate the
value of that that alone right there will change your
whole life to be able to pop out of your
life and look back upon it as though it was
all an imagined hallucination just one state even though you're
not looking at it of course from some other state
when you come back to your ordinary life after your
trip is over that that still changes you that changes
you forever because most people have never had the experience
of being able to pop out of life and look
at it from a different state most people's minds are
so closed they don't recognize that consciousness table of extremely
radical states see most people are so under estimating reality
including spiritual masters and notation teachers and gurus and enlightened
people even they are under estimating what consciousness can do
because what a psychedelic can do for you is orders
of magnitude more than what they can achieve through their
meditations you see when you're meditating mostly for spiritual work
what meditation does is it works on the central knob
of consciousness if you sit and you just focus on
a wall for 10 hours straight you're gonna become so
hyper focused you're turning this consciousness dial up and up
and up and that's great that's very useful for meditation
that could lead to awakenings to enlightenment Stu insights about
reality and all that is good that's what spirituality is
about that's what meditation is for but it's a lot
harder for you to tune and to even know that
there exist other knobs to consciousness it's not lis you
can just sit there and meditation and automatically imagine a
pink elephant and it appears you can't do that that's
hard now actually technically it's possible if you sit and
you imagine a pink elephant while you're meditating and you
do this for months on end like industrial-grade meditation I'm
talking about ten hours a day for months on end
you will actually be able to see a pink elephant
if you did that with enough intention and focus and
serious commitment but it's it would be so much work
that it's outside the realm of most people's abilities or
there's really also I mean what would be the value
in it not much valued either you see so see
most people don't recognize that this is possible except a
few people who have done serious yoga and serious visualization
exercises as part of their spiritual practice then they can
have an idea that such things are possible but with
a psychedelic this becomes effortless you don't need to train
for months you can do it instantly effortlessly and much
more vividly than you can even with months of visualization
practice so most spiritual people they don't understand there are
all these other miscellaneous knobs to consciousness some of them
are very very radical imagine I I twist a knob
of consciousness and if I twist this knob you won't
be able to tell the difference between people and animals
anymore and and and inanimate objects there will be no
difference between a table your mother and a dog if
I twist this knob imagine other knob that I can
twist if I twist this knob time stops now of
course that's that's actually one that you can access through
meditation fairly easily advanced meditators can access this knob and
they can they can make time stop basically but imagine
a knob where you can turn this knob and time
flows backwards you would think like what that's impossible how
could that happen science says it's impossible but you have
to understand science is part of what you're hallucinating science
is a hallucination part of this thing right here that
you're hallucinating when I twist this knob of time flowing
backwards by the time I've twisted that thing all science
has flown out the window there is no more science
at that point because your science you know your science
requires this state that you're in right now to maintain
it one of the biggest problems with science is that
scientists don't recognize that all of modern mainstream science is
done within one out of an infinite number of different
states of consciousness so science really has been mapping a
single state of consciousness the entire time imagine that a
scientist got stuck in a dream his own dream a
single dream from one night he got stuck in it
and he kept exploring that dream and doing science within
that dream and he thought that he understood everything about
that dream because he mapped it all out measured everything
catalogued everything he knows everything about how that dream works
and then he wakes up only to realize like oh
that was just a dream and all of my science
no longer is applicable because that science was inside of
that bubble which now has popped and then the next
night he goes into a new dream and in that
new dream everything has changed it's a totally different dream
new physics new rules new cause and effects everything is
different now he has to restart all of his science
see that's analogous to what modern mainstream science is doing
it's only exploring one state of consciousness and there are
not just two or three different ones there are millions
of them of course just to admit this is extremely
threatening to science as a whole because what scientist wants
to admit that he's devoted his entire career to studying
a dream one out of millions of Dreams in that
there are higher dreams there are lower dreams and higher
dreams and that he's been studying the lower dreams some
of the lowest dreams not the highest ones see that's
how tricky this stuff is imagine that I twist a
knob and you stop being human and you turn into
a beer bottle I twist the knob again and you
turn into a pinecone I twist the knob again you
turn into a kangaroo I twist the knob some more
and you turn into the entire human race not a
single person the entire human race I twist the knob
some more you turn into the planet the entire planet
I twist the knob some more and you turn into
the colour red you're not a living being anymore you're
the colour red sounds trippy sounds impossible right and yet
there is such a nub and many many other knobs
there are so many knobs that do so many freaky
things that there's not enough words in the English language
to explain them all to you it would be like
explaining color to a colorblind person or just to a
blind person I guess is even better so you might
say well okay leo but what so what so yeah
there are all these knobs but what are these knobs
get me okay so I turn into a kangaroo and
then I come back what what's the big deal well
the big deal is just the fact that you became
a kangaroo and came back that completely changes your whole
life that's a huge deal you can't look at reality
the same way again and even a kangaroo is not
weird enough cuz you might think you might even have
some sort of spiritual belief in the back of your
mind that says like well yeah I mean people talking
about reincarnation so maybe maybe I used to be a
kangaroo in the past now I'm a human maybe next
next time I'll be a dog or something or an
alien okay that's still sort of within the realm of
possibility I mean this sort of science fictiony and crazy
but still it it's at least something you can imagine
you can imagine me a kangaroo try to imagine what
it's like to be a beer bottle that's tough what
would that be like what would your attitude be towards
life towards people towards society towards science towards religion if
you became a beer bottle for a day and then
you came back what would that tell you about your
humanity you see if this actually happened to you your
entire life would change even though you would be back
and in a certain sense nothing would have changed because
you're back you're a human now you're in human form
I'm not saying you you need to be a beer
bottle for the rest of your life I'm just saying
just the fact that you experienced it for a little
bit already changes something in you it's sort of like
imagine if you lived in a comfortable gated neighborhood your
whole life in some upscale suburb in California and you
grew up in this sort of cloistered perfect neighborhood it
was all beautiful and nice and you went to nice
schools and ain't nice food and the nice roads nice
cars nice people nice police everything is calm quiet peaceful
beautiful there are neighborhoods like this in California in fact
I live in some of them when I was younger
and then imagine you take one of these people let's
say a teenager 18 years old who's lived in this
idyllic California gated community somewhere like in Beverly Hills and
then we take them from that and we throw them
into a Somalia or Liberia the Congo or somewhere in
the middle of Syria or Iraq into a war-torn area
with with drug dealers gang rape child slavery genocide cannibalism
this is not this is not fantasy these countries and
these kind of life experiences exist right now in the
21st century in certain parts of the world people are
going through those experiences right now right now as you're
sitting here in the comfort of your cozy little domicile
listening to me somebody else right now is getting um
you know gang raped or is a child slave or
is getting shot and tortured so that so imagine we
take this this teen we throw him in the middle
of Liberia somewhere then he has to deal with that
for a few days and then we throw him back
to his Beverly Hills you know upscale neighborhood is he
gonna be the same person after that no when he
sees you know cannibalism and gang rape and and slavery
and all this if he's gonna come back and he's
gonna like he's gonna look at that neighborhood in a
totally different way and that's exactly what psychedelics do now
of course he doesn't have to be negative it can
also be positive conversely we could take a child or
a teen who grew up in Liberia or in Somalia
or wherever some terrible part of the world and we
could plop him into the best neighborhood in Hollywood and
have him live there for a few days and then
plop him back and that's gonna change him to see
he's gonna see new possibilities see he couldn't even imagined
some of the stuff that that's there in that expensive
neighborhood he couldn't be even dreamed of such things while
living that hellhole that he was living in so that's
what psychedelics allow you to do except even more powerful
than that because these differences are still within the realm
of physical reality we can imagine an even more radical
situation where we take a kid from from Iraq and
we throw him to a new planet with an alien
civilization that is a hundred thousand years more advanced than
humanity with teleportation devices and weird hovering technology and telepathic
communication abilities and all sorts of crazy stuff they figured
out how to make their bodies immortal right so all
this crazy stuff that they figured out from the wildest
science-fiction movies imagine wheat we plop a kid from Iraq
into that for a day and then we bring him
back that's a little bit more what it's like to
take a psychedelic that's how radical that is and even
that is still not radical enough because even in that
example we're still within the three-dimensional physical material world it
changes you it can change you profoundly now also it's
not a cure-all I'm not saying that you do this
you know if you take a kid from Iraq and
you throw him into Beverly Hills for a week and
then you put them back into Iraq is he gonna
like all the sudden be an instant you know Hollywood
celebrity back in Iraq no of course not a week
is not long enough to pick up and learn everything
there is to learn about what it's like to be
an American elite there's so much there to learn so
that's the challenge with psychedelics the psychedelic has so much
to teach you yet it gives you so little time
relatively speaking even a long trip of eight hours some
of the longest like an Elissa LSD can give you
a solid maybe six release even LSD doesn't give you
that much time it gives you about six solid hours
of tripping and then some after-effects that linger for another
four or five hours but the the solid trip itself
only lasts about six hours so in those six hours
that's a lot of time but they they pass so
fast when you're in a totally new realm and there's
so much to learn there about yourself and about reality
and consciousness that it flies by in seconds and then
you're back and yeah of course you can't hold it
all it's too much it's way too much so one
of the biggest challenges that you come back and you're
you're like whoa what the hell was that how do
I make sense of that how do I embody that
how do i how do I bring a piece of
that back into ordinary life that's challenging but you also
can you can bring back you're not gonna bring back
the whole thing you're gonna bring back one percent of
it and you might say oh well one percent that's
so piddly but one percent of a giant thing is
still significant see and then of course you can go
back and you can trip again and again and again
and not only will you be going back to the
same places again and again again you will be going
to new places further and further each trip will expand
your capacity to go further and deeper and explore more
and more territory explore more and more corners of consciousness
and it just keeps growing you more and more and
each time you come back you bring one percent back
one percent back one percent back well if you do
it a hundred times that's a hundred percent right there
takes work it's not easy this is not a some
magic pill and it takes a lot of work just
sit there to contemplate it all after you come back
because you're gonna see such crazy and radical things in
these trips that when you come back you're gonna be
like what the [ __ ] was that and you're
gonna spend a week just in the shower what the
[ __ ] was that cooking your food what the
[ __ ] was that driving to work what the
[ __ ] was that sitting at work doing your
work what the [ __ ] was that thinking thinking
that trying to wrap your mind around it try to
remember and trying to figure it out and that's a
very very valuable process you might by doing that process
this is what I call integration work by contemplating that
you'll actually be able to extract a few more percent
so rather just bring back one percent by contemplating it
you'll be back bring back 3% 4% 5% depending on
how good you contemplate and so over time this all
adds up and before you know it 50 or 100
trips into this your whole life has been turned upside
down and it in a positive way because what's happening
is that your your sense of what reality is is
being expanded you're being pushed beyond your comfort zone metaphysically
episodically psychologically and of course it's not just about don't
get me wrong here it's not just about exploring some
alien territories that's that's actually not mostly what it's about
a lot of these trips are about exploring your own
self what you are your own psyche your own past
your own memories your own wounds and grudges and fears
and trying to figure out your own life what your
purpose here is in life how to live your life
better and so forth because even though the psychedelics can
tune all these other little minor knobs the most important
knob is the central knob of consciousness by tuning that
up that makes you more conscious of everything about yourself
and about reality and that is really the whole not
the whole but the majority of the value of the
psychedelic is tuning that knob because by tuning the consciousness
knob up you can contemplate and introspect and have profound
insights into the nature of anything science relationships sexuality business
life death awakening spirituality politics Social Sciences race relations love
emotions psychology psychotherapy you name it it doesn't matter any
topic will be enhanced with more consciousness whatever you're interested
in but practically speaking what's gonna make the biggest difference
for most people is tuning up that knob of consciousness
as high as it can go and then introspecting and
trying to get to the bottom of who you are
why you're here what is life what is reality what
is existence what is love what are emotions what is
the mind these sorts of existential questions all of these
questions can be answered and the insights you get are
legitimate highly truthful insights now of course it is possible
to delude yourself and the less pure that you are
the more wounds you have the more shadow material the
more psychic baggage you have the more dysfunctional you are
in your life less mature you are the less developed
you are the less conscious you are generally speaking the
more likely you are to delude yourself with these psychedelic
experiences but then again that's true in your ordinary hallucination
as well this hallucination right now see the key mistake
that scientists and rationalist and skeptics make about psychedelics is
they think that will believe oh if I go to
that psychedelic realm how will I know that it's true
but even to ask that question is already that questions
being asked from such an ignorant place because if you
were at that realm if you understood how this knob
of consciousness works you would just laugh because this current
state that you're in this hallucination that you're taking for
granted this default hallucination that you're in right now this
is one of the lowest least truthful most delusional of
all the possible hallucinations see the scientist makes the mistake
of thinking like well okay if I think this psychedelic
is gonna take me to some sort of hallucination land
and whose salvation land won't be as real as real
land what we call life material reality and then when
I come back to a material reality how will I
know that that hallucination land I mean is just hallucination
and now I'm back in real reality no it works
exactly the opposite way you take the psychedelic you go
into real land you look back upon where you came
from and this is hallucination land this is delusion land
right here right now what's going on here material reality
so how is this possible you might wonder if you're
still struggling to stomach some of the radical possibilities I've
put forth here the reason that is is because your
model of reality your paradigm is actually incapable of reconciling
what I'm saying because what I'm saying doesn't square with
material reality that you learned in middle school the reality
of bouncing atoms and molecules and all that it doesn't
square with that it doesn't square with the reality that
consciousness is created by a brain that's right those are
stories those are paradigms and models that are completely inadequate
for understanding reality at its highest levels that's kindergarten stuff
all the advanced science you think you're doing it's kindergarten
stuff compared to what you get when you're really conscious
and that means you have to be open-minded and humble
enough to say okay I have to be able to
admit that my old paradigms were wrong and highly limited
they're not all wrong they're just extremely limited in scope
is the point and you have to be willing to
open your mind and to go explore new realities and
contemplate and figure out new paradigms your paradigms need to
be completely retooled that takes intellectual work and emotional labor
it's not just the work of sitting there and doing
math equations that's easy work the really hard work is
that for you to access and to understand reality at
the highest levels you have to change as a being
as who you are your whole emotional system needs to
change all of your your entire web of beliefs of
how reality works needs to change but how is it
gonna change when you're so attached to it when your
career hinges on it when your family and your relationships
hinge on it are you willing to give all that
up in order to understand reality if not then you've
confined yourself to this little limited domain and that's where
you will remain you're like an ant an ant all
it knows is the little surrounds maybe a one-mile radius
around its ant colony in the rainforest somewhere and nothing
else that's all you'll ever know you'll always be that
annual you'll never understand anything about the planet except that
one mile radius around you little ant colony that's what
most scientists are like that's what most religious people are
like that's what most spiritual people are like that's what
most ordinary people who do just normal self-improvement and they
just want money in a house and a family and
so forth that's what they're like they'll never know what's
beyond it takes courage to venture beyond it takes radical
open-mindedness it takes risk there's risk involved with it all
exploration involves risk you never know what you're going to
find that's the very nature of exploration you don't know
what's out there maybe you'll find some terrible demon who
will kill you maybe or maybe you'll find God who
will bless you maybe maybe you'll find some alien maybe
you don't know until you go there and see so
the paradigm that you need to be able to make
sense of psychedelics is the following one throw away your
old materials and chemicals this is a fiction there never
was such a thing your new paradigm is that there
never was an objective material external reality there is no
reality outside of appearance and subjective perception none reality is
consciousness and there is nothing but consciousness which means that
reality is an infinite mind this mind can imagine anything
right now it happens to be imagining this body sitting
here speaking to you and that body over there sitting
there listening to me that's what it happens to be
imagining right now the next second who knows what could
imagine it can imagine anything it wants but it just
so happens that it keeps imagining something consistent so that
we can get a sense of reality because if this
imagine something totally new right now there would be no
sense of reality you would be basically like in a
dream the only difference between a dream and reality is
that here in reality it's very stable consciousness is extremely
stable that's what makes it feel real and concrete you
might say well Leo if everything was just an illusion
like you're saying everything was a closed nation I should
be able to walk through a wall no you shouldn't
because the hallucination is that you can't walk through a
wall you're hallucinating solidity you see throw away your stupid
simplistic naive ideas of what a hallucination is I'm talking
about a robust deeply sophisticated notion of hallucination hallucinations that
are so real you cannot distinguish them from reality hallucinations
that are so mesmerizing that imagine that you started imagining
that you were a kangaroo and you just sat there
day after day after day imagining that you were a
kangaroo and you imagined it so much that you literally
became a kangaroo and you could not remember anymore that
you were ever a human that's the kind of power
of imagination that I'm talking about that is the power
of infinite mind everything that is occurring and can ever
occur has only occurred and will ever occur inside of
an infinite mind this mind is not connected to a
brain of any kind it's not happening inside of any
computer it's pure mind pure mind that's what this is
that's what you are that's what psychedelics are and material
reality is one one out of an infinite number literally
an infinite number of states of consciousness that are possible
that are inside of this mind material reality is a
special case and if you're a scientifically inclined person then
you should appreciate this this term in this concept of
a special case a special limiting case of something much
broader and more general for example there's Hein Stein's general
relativity and then there's special relativity I sign special relativity
Einstein first developed special relativity which explained time dilation in
the relativity of of motion in like a us basically
a single direction it was uniform motion basically velocity it
didn't deal with accelerations but then Einstein you know he
came up with his special relativity and it was very
groundbreaking in this paradigm shattering discovery for physics which basically
showed that you know time time dilated depending on how
your velocity was changing and so forth and it showed
that velocity and you know distances and all this and
the speed of light and how these things are um
you know relative depending on the position of the reference
frame so it's kind of complicated but I'm just glossing
over it here so that was special relativity but then
you know he came up with that he said okay
we got that but but what about except you know
more complicated types of motion what about acceleration because I
haven't accounted for acceleration yet and then he came up
with general relativity which was his crowning achievement which but
see general relativity didn't nullify special relativity what it what
Einstein realized is that AHA special relativity is just a
special confined instance of a more broad dynamic of relativity
which we're going to call general relativity which includes accelerations
because velocity is just you can wrap velocity into acceleration
velocity is a special case of acceleration where acceleration is
zero see so that's that's the analogy we're using here
to try to explain material reality material reality is just
a special case of an infinite number of states that
consciousness can imagine when consciousness is imagining something very consistently
like it's the same this second it's again the same
the next second and again the next second then the
illusion of reality and concreteness and materiality is created but
if on second one this is a hand on second
- it's a flipper on second three it's a claw
on second four it's a tentacle on second five it's
a wing you see that's then you're gonna call that
something crazy you're not gonna call that reality but of
course you have to recognize that what you call reality
is completely relative and arbitrary you just call reality whatever
you're familiar with for the most part so that's the
paradigm you got to have universal mind imagining everything with
no limits there's no limits to what can imagine but
there also are limits to what your human body and
this life can do because you are sort of in
this life and in this body for now and as
long as you're here and you want this particular stream
of consciousness to continue you have to understand that that
that creates certain constraints serious constraints such that even when
you take a psychedelic you have to take a lot
of psychedelic to completely like leave your body behind on
a moderate dose of psychedelics you're still gonna have almost
total control of your body you're still gonna be able
to feel your body move your body do things no
problem you'll be able to walk and talk and and
do that but I mean if you take a really
massive dose even your body will disappear melt away but
you know those those get into dangerous territory when you
get into doses like that you're you're playing with a
loaded gun and that's why psychedelics rightly so are feared
because when you get into high doses like that at
that point potentially you could hurt yourself physically you could
overdose certain psychedelics are actually lethal at very high doses
others are not for example mushrooms you basically can't overdose
on those you can eat 30 grams of mushrooms and
you'll still be alive but but the problem is not
just physical the problem is also mental because at such
high doses reality will be warped so seriously that it's
really gonna be difficult psychologically to handle what's happening to
you you're gonna be torn apart your whole mind and
your whole paradigm of reality will be torn to pieces
so asked and so radically that you're not just gonna
be able to sit there and and carefully piece it
all together no it's like you're gonna get a sledgehammer
to the skull sort of thing and then you'll be
picking up the pieces for a year to come and
it can terrify you it can cause panic attacks whatever
you know it all a lot of it depends on
how much you can handle how mature are you how
serious are you are you pacing yourself properly or are
you overdosing you know you can get to those high
doses but you got to slowly ramp up to it
you can't just jump into it with cold feet you
got to become an experienced psycho not you got to
do 50 trips first on mild doses before you're able
to do a high dose and handle it successfully in
a healthy way it doesn't come back and hurt you
and leave you with some sort of PTSD or nightmares
or something so let me explain a little bit further
about what's really going on this is where it gets
kind of incredible well let's let's see if you're open-minded
enough I'll just tell it to you straight so what's
really happening with a psychedelic is that the psychedelic interferes
with the dream that God has been dreaming which is
your life you are God which is infinite mind pure
infinite mind that decided to dream up a particular dream
the one that you're in right now this material dream
and this material dream had to be very very stable
and persistent because if it wasn't you couldn't have a
stable mind or a stable life you couldn't raise a
family you couldn't have a society you couldn't be a
functioning member of society if there wasn't a stable earth
and a stable society that you could be a member
of you see so so Universal Mind God's mind imagine
your particular life and it's imagining it right now as
I'm speaking try to maybe become conscious of this as
I'm speaking if you can your God imagining all this
and the psychedelic will interfere with that pre-planned dream that
you're dreaming now of course the psychedelic is also part
of the dream that you're dreaming so it's not like
psychedelics go against God I mean God imagines psychedelics just
as much as anything else so it's not like you're
doing anything against God's will here but it will interrupt
the flow of the ordinary dream and shift you into
some new territory some new kind of dream and when
you take a psychedelic what happens is that literally everything
starts to melt around you you can you can really
feel the fluidity of consciousness that's one of the biggest
things you feel on a psychedelic the difference between rigid
consciousness as it is right now versus fluid consciousness where
everything is morphing around and what's really happening there is
the following thing is that God's mind is sort of
opening up and expanding to its infinite potential into more
abstract and abstract layers of pure imagination at the highest
levels of imagination there are no fixed rules or objects
of any kind everything is amorphous and fluid because it's
literally just as though coming out of the mind see
in the same way that thoughts formulate in your mind
as you're writing a sentence or writing a paper or
an article in the same way thoughts or even material
objects are sort of formulated in the mind of God
before they materialize so you don't notice that right now
because they're already materialized here it's solid it's locked in
but with the psychedelic consciousness will open up become more
fluid and you will actually enter the stream of imagination
through which God imagines all of existence including your current
material life you will be able to look at your
hand for example and you will see how you are
actually literally imagining this hand into existence as God and
the psychedelic makes this imagination process so fluid and so
creative and so open so abstract and so amorphous that
literally you can look at a wall and you can
think of an elephant and you will see an elephant
in the wall because as it turns out that's the
actual mechanism by which all of reality is created it's
not really that you're hallucinating or something is wrong with
you you're not going crazy if you see an elephant
in the wall what's happening is I mean really Law
of Attraction is happening but Law of Attraction is happening
at such a elevated state of consciousness that literally you
are materializing the things that you are thinking will and
thought and materialization and potential and actual all of these
merge into one and from this super fluid state you
are able to imagine entirely new worlds and realities you
know how when you're daydreaming you can just sit there
maybe in class you're bored when you used to be
in you know literature class or something in high school
you were so bored you would just sit there and
stare out the window and just daydream as a teacher
was yakking on about Shakespeare or something and you were
sitting there you're just daydreaming about some videogame world that
you wanted to inhabit and you just got lost in
this sort of reverie of this sort of fantasy world
you into this world you were running around as an
elf doing something fighting somebody whatever that is a little
taste a little microcosm of what can really happen what
God is doing on the macro level of course you
as a human have such limited capacity for imagination but
when you crank up the consciousness and you crank up
all these other dials your imagination goes through the roof
your creativity goes through the roof you literally tap into
the source of creativity infant pure infinite creativity which is
responsible for the creation and the imagination of all of
material reality this pure creativity is responsible for creating atoms
molecules planets galaxies science mankind languages animals you name it
and you're tapping into that and it feels so surreal
and unbelievable because it's too good to be true here
you were living this ordinary life thinking that reality is
just material and physical and now one day you find
yourself in the nexus of creation where God's mind is
creating the entire [ __ ] universe and you discover
that that's you who's been doing it the whole time
it's utterly shocking and astounding it's so astounding that you
won't want to believe it because people have told you
all it's egotistical to say that you're God only a
narcissist would claim that he's God you're imagining the entire
[ __ ] universe what does that make you that
makes you God reality is pure imagination tada but to
really comprehend what that means to actually experience it not
just to hear it for me as a story not
just to take it on as a dog murder the
ideology but to really live that even for a short
while that takes a lot that takes a lot of
maturity and development from you taste a lot of curiosity
and open-mindedness takes a lot of fearlessness selflessness you already
have to be on the spiritual path one of the
biggest mistakes that people who take psychedelics make is simply
that the people who take it because psychedelics are sort
of an underground thing quasi illegal in certain parts of
the world it's such a sort of a shady area
of course why is a shady because it disrupts the
nature of what reality is you can't you can't build
a society without how long psychedelics at least not society
in its current form so so of course society represses
these things and forces them underground Sigma ties them demonize
them because this is the greatest threat to society this
is the greatest threat to power this is the greatest
threat to people who want money power and sex and
selfishness so under understand why psychedelics are demonized or demonized
for a very good reason not because they're physically gonna
harm you or cause you to lose your mind but
because they threaten power structures and they threaten the whole
sense of reality that our culture has constructed which is
artificial and super limited so I lost my train of
thought there's so many when my mind thinks it's thinking
so many parallel trains of flawed at once that the
most difficult thing for me to do is to pick
any particular one it's like I'm I'm multi parallel processing
10 strands at once and so keeping track of all
of them at the same time that's that's like the
most difficult thing that I have to deal with and
teaching this stuff because I can only speak one thing
at a time but my mind is thinking ten different
chains of thought at once so anyways I lost that
one but let's pick up on another one um all
right so so I told you the parrot how the
parrot on the new paradigm you need it's always an
imagination understand that oh yeah I was saying uh yeah
the biggest problem with psychedelic users yeah they're just they're
so immature because this underground thing they're so immature and
so underdeveloped that when they take a psychedelic a lot
of times what they get is they get a reflection
of their own inner self this nasty ugly underdeveloped devilish
demonic inner self yeah then they get terrified they run
away and they never do a second look again yeah
of course of course but when a pure person takes
a psychedelic it's a completely different experience the determining factor
or what psychedelics is not the substance itself that you
take or even the dose its your internal purity how
pure is your mind how pure is your heart how
much shadow material do you have that really determines how
your trip is gonna go the pure you are in
heart and mind and soul and spirit the more selfless
you are the more work you've done on yourself the
more mature you are the more developed you are the
more open-minded you are the more fearless you are the
more curious you are the deeper you contemplate the better
your trips will go and the more insight you'll gather
now of course people wonder Willie oh but how do
you know you can trust these insights it's a foolish
question because insight is insight insight is a direct consciousness
into the nature of a thing some aspect of reality
when you have a direct insight it's absolutely true now
of course you can misinterpret insights easily quite easily so
I'm not saying this is foolproof there's a lot of
self deception potential here but then again there's everywhere but
what you'll discover with psychedelics is that the insights are
more true and more more powerful and more certain than
anything that you are able to access in ordinary waking
consciousness ordinary life really what you should be questioning is
why do you attach so much importance and truth and
significance to ordinary consciousness ordinary life right here this is
just a hallucination after all even under the scientific materialists
paradigm what assigns tell you science tells you that you
have neurotransmitters flowing through your brain all the time not
only when you take a psychedelic all the time right
now if you want to believe science there are neurotransmitters
running through your head right now which are responsible for
generating all the colors sounds and everything here without those
neurotransmitters you could not understand the words that I'm saying
nor could you recognize yourself or myself as human beings
you could not access memories you could not understand what
time or space are right so my question to you
is how how myopic would you have to be if
that's the case that if this current experience you're having
is completely dominated by neurotransmitters how myopic would you have
to be how arrogant would you have to be to
think that this current configuration of neurotransmitters is the one
true one the one from which you can understand what's
true and what's false see so the irony of people
who criticize psychedelics is that they themselves are doing it
from a state of hallucination but they're so ignorant and
oblivious and lacking in self reflection that they don't understand
that what they're doing is you're criticizing psychedelics from a
state of hallucination and delusion they're not self-aware enough to
realize that oh well neurotransmitters are governing my entire state
right now so if I'm sitting here thinking that all
those psychedelics they must be stupid they must be false
that's being run by the neurotransmitters in here so now
imagine what happens if we change the neurotransmitter cocktail to
something else which neurotransmitter cocktail is the one true one
that allows you to access the truth well the mistake
is seeing that there is one cocktail I'm not saying
there's one cocktail you're saying there's only one cocktail and
you're taking your current cocktail as the one true one
what I'm telling you is that there's an infinite number
of cocktails there is no one true one the truth
is that all cocktails our relative and they just generate
appearances and that's it that is the truth the truth
is not a particular vision or cocktail that you have
or see do the truth is a meta thing the
truth is not one particular state of consciousness the truth
is the realization that everything is a state of consciousness
and that there is nothing but states of consciousness that's
the real truth and psychedelics are very helpful for getting
you to access that you see one of the things
that these enlightened masters and teachers who poopoo psychedelics one
of the things they don't tell you when they tell
you that psychedelics just change your state yes psychedelics change
your state but this is so foolish because different states
grant you different access to insight and truth not all
states are the same and this current state you're in
I got news for you this is one of the
worst possible states for accessing truth there are a hundred
other states of consciousness that are way better way clear
for accessing truth and the only way you're gonna know
that is by entering those states you can't stay in
your current state and judge some other state out there
you have to be wise enough to recognize that oh
I could be trapped inside of a state I need
to break out of this state and see other states
before I can really determine how good my original state
was you see you can't just start out assuming that
your state is the best state that's a silly as
the way that humans used to think that the earth
was the center of the universe and at the Sun
everything else revolved around the earth why did they think
that because they were so myopic and self-centered that they
just thought that well this current configuration is the best
one it must be the center of everything I got
news for you it ain't the center of anything this
is just one planet orbiting one star inside of a
giant galaxy with billions of stars and then a universe
with billions and billions more of galaxies just like this
one with trillions of planets and God knows what else
that's that's the scope we're talking about here your current
state of consciousness he's as limited as living on earth
compared to all the other planets in the universe that's
how limited your experience of consciousness and reality is so
taking psychedelics is not about achieving some wonderful state some
blissful state it's about getting insight into the nature of
how the entire system works and it's very useful to
enter certain states to get that insight and this is
precisely why meditation is done meditation is you sitting there
focusing intently single pointedly on a single object in your
mind or out in the world for long periods of
times such that your mind focuses so much that literally
your state of consciousness starts to change naturally now of
course this is this takes a lot of work to
do what a psychedelic can do in five minutes will
take you five years of meditation practice but but if
you want you can do it through meditation and in
fact if you're an advanced meditator what you've noticed is
actually very similar effects to psychedelics if you sit there
and you focus on just an object in your room
and you focus on it for 10 hours straight what's
gonna happen is that your visual field will start to
morph and will start to melt and it'll start to
Sparkle and there will be you will literally start to
get mild visual hallucination what is actually happening the reason
that's happening is because your state of consciousness is expanding
work we're actually through meditation we're tuning that dial up
hanging up state of consciousness expands to the point where
actually material reality starts to lose its shape just a
little bit just a tiny little bit and your visual
feel sourced to morph a little bit like this as
you're meditating and even in Buddhism they have sayings like
we're you know monks would meditate a professional lifetime monks
would meditate for four months and four years and then
they would they would talk about the dancing Buddha statue
well you know in every Buddhist temple they have of
course a statue of the Buddha but dancing Buddha why
would why would the Buddha dance the Buddha's just sitting
there so is that some sort of cute metaphor what
are they really talking about these Buddhists why don't have
to be so mystical and schmick Stickle and airy-fairy and
new agey why can't they just be scientific about it
well of course when they're talking about the dancing Buddha
what they're really talking about is they're sitting there focusing
looking at the Buddha statue for so [ __ ]
long that it they start to hallucinate how the thing
it just like on LSD search to morph like this
the statue actually starts to morph and dance in their
visual field that's your dancing Buddha it's literal see but
to reach that state you have to be a super
advanced meditator which many of you aren't because you're too
lazy and too unserious about this work and you know
that's hard it's hard way to go these days when
I sit and meditate just for a little bit you
know 15 minutes here and there in my room I
get I start to get visual hallucinations they're very mild
like on a very mild mild mild dose on mushrooms
or LSD and to me that's a good sign that
means I'm meditating properly hoping that happens but of course
many people would freak out they would think all something's
wrong with me no that's exactly what you want and
the deeper you go to meditation the more likely that
stuff is to happen if you become a very advanced
meditator you can literally hallucinate you know in objects and
beings into existence because what's happening is you're tapping into
that pure abstract creative potential of mind that's exactly what
you want of course it can be kind of freaky
but a psychedelic is that times a thousand see so
again the point is not to achieve some blissful state
or to see some cool colors or to travel to
some new dimension you can do all those things that's
nice that's fun the point is the lessons the insights
you get and the meta understanding of how this entire
process works because as you're exploring all you different domains
which are really learning is you're learning about your own
mind how the mind of God is generating reality and
why it's generating it if your mind is impure yeah
you're gonna see some terrible stuff why because you're literally
imagining it into existence so the trick with psychedelics is
that they're a very powerful tool but don't get me
wrong I'm not saying that they should be your only
tool and that you shouldn't do anything else I have
shared with you throughout previous episodes and I will in
the future dozens perhaps even a hundred different techniques for
how to do spiritual work how to work on yourself
meditation self inquiry Kriya yoga shamanic breathing visualization exercises contemplation
techniques and many many others so many that I can't
even recall them all right now those are all important
techniques and you're not going to be able to use
only psychedelics to master yourself and to master your life
get to where you really want to get to so
don't fall into that naive mistake that trap rather psychedelics
are very powerful catalysts very powerful tool for exploring consciousness
and reality they can significantly speed up your awakening process
they can clear up a lot of confusion they can
help you to face fear of death which is one
of the biggest obstacles for awakening for people they can
get you to understand and have glimpses of awakening they
can get you to do shadow work work on trauma
and stuff that's holding you back they can show you
your life purpose they can give you wisdom and guidance
about what to do in your life which decisions to
make for major life decisions they can help you to
be creative with your art or your business they could
help you to deal with relationship problems they can help
you to sort out your own sexuality integrate the masculine
and the feminine inside of you they can show you
God they can show you love they can show you
truth but really you're only gonna get what you give
you're only gonna get from psychedelics what you put into
it it all depends on the seriousness of your commitment
your curiosity your open-mindedness and how much you want to
grow up one of the other things psychedelics will do
is psychedelics will skyrocket your growth in terms of spiral
dynamics if you haven't checked out my spiral dynamics multi-part
series go check it out it talks about the development
of human beings various stages usually with active work you
can take about 5 years for a person to grow
from one spiral stage to the next so if you're
at blue it'll take you four maybe five years of
active self-improvement work to grow to orange and then it'll
take another five years to grow from or two green
another five from green to yellow and that's with active
deliberate work assuming that you're open-minded you're completely aware of
the model and everything and you're working every day towards
it if you're not doing that then it might take
you 20-30 years to grow one level with psychedelics with
consistent use of psychedelics you can speed that up you
can probably grow a couple of levels I mean one
level every couple of years they will skyrocket you to
the highest levels so that's one of the other advantages
that they have if you're a scientist psychedelics will totally
transform how you think of and do science which actually
brings me to a nice analogy that I wanted to
present heroes story because I find that scientifically minded people
are some of the densest some of the densest minds
they're so smart they're stupid and that they forget the
true nature of science so here's my story Galileo Galilei
in the 1600s he built his own telescope now he
wasn't the first human to invent the telescope somebody else
invented it but he caught on to the design very
early on and he was one of the first people
in Europe to build his own private little telescope it's
all little bling nothing major but this telescope was such
a radical technology that he turned it up towards the
Stars and he started looking at the moon in greater
detail than anyone has ever looked at it and he
looked at Venus and neighboring planets like Jupiter and the
moons of Jupiter he was actually able to look at
the moons of Jupiter count them and describe them in
some minor detail and then he of course started porting
these discoveries but as he was reporting them of course
the Spanish Inquisition in all of Europe basically which was
very Catholic at the time this was I think even
pre pre Protestant Reformation so as all Catholics you know
Catholicism had a hegemony and a monopoly on on the
entire thought structure of Europe and you have to really
appreciate the significance of this at that time Christianity and
science the study of reality they were intertwined there was
no such thing as scientists in some laboratory over there
and then theologians and the Pope over here and that
there was a brick wall between the two no universities
the first universities that were probably getting established around that
time they were all theological based in theology based in
Christianity so all of the main scientists of that time
and there were scientists but most of them were actually
religious folk priests and theologians and so forth and they
were they were interested in studying reality but of course
only within the paradigm of Christianity so when Galileo presented
his findings of these moods and and planets so forth
to the to the higher-ups what do they do they
embrace some and they say oh wow you you created
a telescope wow that's an amazing tool let me let
me use this thing and and validate your discoveries no
they demonized him they looked at his results and they
said what sorcery is this planets you're counting moons and
planets that shouldn't even exist up there who are you
to contradict God it says here in our Bible that
there can't be those moons out there there's only X
number of planets X number of moons one moon and
no more and yada yada yada and then when Galileo
told them and remember these were scientists he this is
the mistake that modern scientists make when they think about
this example of course modern scientists understand this example but
what modern scientists and a Thea and skeptics and rationalist
misunderstand is that they use this example as an example
of religious dogma suppressing science no no no this is
an example of science being locked in a paradigm and
being unable to understand new forms of science this is
not an example of religion this is an example of
science so the scientists of the time who just happened
to be religious when they saw the results they rejected
the results and when Galileo told them hey look this
is I'm not making this stuff up this is not
like if some belief system of mine I used a
telescope to look and to see I saw with my
own eyes look come come guys look at the telescope
you can see for yourself too you don't need to
believe me I'm not I'm not trying to create some
sort of alternative Dogma to Christianity here I'm just reporting
facts that I observed so what did those scientists do
did they say okay let me look in the telescope
no of course not they said what devil's instrument is
that why should we trust this instrument of the devil
to report accurate observations and they didn't even bother to
look through the telescope that's a textbook example of closed
mindedness and paradigm lock you are so locked into a
paradigm and you are so closed-minded that you refuse to
even open yourself up to a new modality of looking
at reality that might disprove your paradigm that is the
very definition of paradigm lock and you don't know what
paradigm lock is I have a whole episode I believe
it's called understanding how paradigms work go search for that
you'll find it on YouTube mmm very important episode what
we're talking about here so yeah so so these folks
were locked into this paradigm so much that they refused
to even look through a telescope because their paradigm didn't
recognize the validity of a telescope well guess what's happening
today with psychedelics today psychedelics are that telescope and today's
scientists are those theologians of the past who denied to
Galileo his very clear discoveries why because they were afraid
to look into that telescope for themselves why because their
paradigm was so limited that it didn't allow them to
look through that telescope that's exactly what's happening today with
modern science as soon as modern science begins to recognize
psychedelics as a valid tool for the exploration of a
reality everything in science will change it will be a
game-changer bigger than Galileo bigger than Newton and bigger than
Einstein there are a few a small pocket handful of
scientists who are on the cutting edge exploring psychedelics right
now and they will make groundbreaking discoveries the problem though
is that they will be demonized and stigmatized and that
most of these scientists who are doing this research if
they're in a university they have to do it underground
they can't tell their students or their colleagues especially that
they do psychedelics because as soon as they say that
I do psychedelics to advance my science and that my
science is more accurate because I do psychedelics than your
science without psychedelics as soon as you say that you're
a heretic that's when the academic Inquisition comes for you
that's when you lose your job that's when you stop
being taken seriously exactly because science is a cultural phenomenon
science is not merely about gathering data science involves meta
scientific issues that are metaphysical and epistemological which involve questions
of method the question of which methods reveal the truth
this is an open question you don't know which methods
are legitimate or illegitimate until you try them and with
psychedelics with a psychedelic method it's not enough to do
it once or twice or even five times because what
you're looking at is such a gigantic and profound territory
that it would be equivalent to let's say let's say
I was one of these deniers of Galileo and finally
he convinced me to try the telescope you know he
said here just leo try the telescope just look in
it if you don't see it if you don't see
anything that confirms what I'm saying then you can throw
it away and you can continue to prosecute me or
persecute me but just looking at at least once so
I say okay fine fine give me your damn telescope
I'll look through this Devils glass once so I take
it I look through it I look where where do
I look I look at the wall I don't see
anything and I throw it away and I say ah
I see nothing you were full of [ __ ]
Galileo you're an idiot see this isn't this is not
real science it doesn't work this way to truly explore
and investigate something you have to be willing to to
work at it it's not easy to understand a new
thing you know like if somebody like Newton invented calculus
the first people try to imagine the first people who
try to learn calculus from you and that was difficult
there was no frame of reference there was no authority
that told you that calculus was true you have to
actually work through it and maybe it was wrong you
didn't know you had to actually work through it and
check it that could have taken you years to do
likewise with Galileo's telescope you had to look at the
Stars carefully you have to wait till it's the right
time of day or night when there's no clouds no
rain no obstructions you got to find the right places
in the sky to look you got to look at
them carefully with an open mind only then can you
see what Galileo saw so it's not a matter of
just some bumbling fool who looks through a glass and
boom the truth is revealed it's not that simple likewise
it's not so simple to psychedelic we're just you're some
idiot ad at a friend's house some sort of party
where people are drunk and you pop some mushrooms and
you think that okay well Leo told me this will
reveal the truth I take some mushrooms while I'm drunk
and I'm smoking weed and I'm [ __ ] with
my friends talking [ __ ] loud music is playing
yeah you're not gonna get anything out of that but
if you carefully methodically work through it multiple trips multiple
substances really introspect contemplate have the right intention be mature
be serious about it start with slow doses low doses
ramp yourself up to medium doses then to high doses
if you explore it in that fashion then it's a
totally different ballgame then now you're now you're into into
real science now you're into the real work and so
that is what's required alright I'm going to wrap this
up here this episode was designed for future Psychonauts I
see a lot of people doing psychedelics and irresponsible ways
that makes me disappointed because of the power of these
these tools it would be sort of like if Galileo
had telescopes and he you know he crafted five new
telescopes to give to people to scientists and they took
these telescopes and they used them to sexually pleasure themselves
that would be the equivalent how how many people use
psychedelics so don't don't do that this is a this
is a delicate scientific instrument that you want to use
in a precise and methodical manner to grow yourself and
to understand reality in in profound ways so treat it
with respect I don't recommend people under 21 years old
toy around with psychedelics because you're just too immature at
that age I feel it really takes maturity these substances
require respect and care you got to be careful with
your protocol all of those things I've talked about in
the past there are risks involved of course you know
when you're looking through a telescope you might look at
the Sun if you look at the Sun through a
telescope you'll burn your eyes out there's risks with exploration
you got to be careful if you're working in a
laboratory as a chemist and you're doing some chemistry experiments
there's a risk that you'll mix two chemicals and it's
going to explode in some sort of toxic cloud into
your face you know early pioneers in science who did
research into a radioactivity they died from radiation poisoning yeah
science can be dangerous exploration can be dangerous luckily most
psychedelics are not that dangerous they're not going to destroy
your brain that's one of the that's one of the
the best excuses it seems like the more intelligent a
person is the more of an intellectual they are the
more of an excuse they make against psychedelics by telling
me that all leo but if I try though psychedelics
is going to destroy my brain and then I won't
be able to be the you know brilliant intellectual that
I am that's like saying that looking through a telescope
who will burn your eyes out by looking at the
moon or looking at the Stars it's just excuses it's
just excuses born of ignorance the mind is looking for
justifications of its paradigm because it doesn't want to challenge
its own paradigm see so yeah I recommend you be
very careful be very responsible if you choose to venture
into psychedelics by no means am i pressuring you to
I'm not saying you have to I'm just I'm putting
this out there because I feel like somebody will go
on the internet go on YouTube type in something like
how does psychedelics work what does psychedelics mean and they'll
stumble upon this talk and for at least some of
you this will transform your entire life if you really
take to heart what I said here contemplate it all
for yourself don't believe any of it verify for yourself
go on this journey man the sky is the limit
the rewards are unspeakable from doing this work and of
course it's not just the psychedelics it's even more importantly
it's the contemplation behind it it's the intent to want
to understand reality and consciousness which is what my entire
channel actual eyes already is about so now we're wrapping
up this is the end and here I got to
pitch my channel so this is my website actualize downward
right here go click there you can find my blog
you can find the course you can find the life

I do a lot of research into this I don't
just read books all of the stuff in this episode
has come from direct experience massive breakthroughs nearly a hundred
trips dozens of breakthrough trips wracking my mind over this
stuff for years experimenting with substances that no man has
even ingested before like this is a lot of work
goes into this money too so I do appreciate your
support via patreon and yeah the final thing I'll say
is that everything that I talk about in my videos
is designed to create a foundation for existential understanding of
reality what we're doing here is we're inquiring into the
nature of life death Society consciousness reality science government psychology
how our emotions work how to be happy in life
how to be successful how to be healthy all of
that it's a very holistic approach you're not likely to
find a more holistic big picture understanding channel on all
of YouTube I dare you to find one that goes
into this level of depth but for you to be
able to receive what is being offered here via these
videos via these conversations I have one very difficult precondition
prerequisite of you and that is radical open mindedness radical
open mindedness you need to be absolutely open minded you
need me so open minded that it will destroy your
whole life and you are still gonna be open minded
go check out an older episode of mine called radical
open mindedness where I talk about that but that is
that is the number one obstacle that holds people back
from going as deep as I can take you your
mind is just not open enough you're too judgmental you're
too ideological you're too attached to your beliefs you're too
arrogant you think you know how a reality is and
how it works and you might say here will leo
but you act so arrogant yourself so you're a hypocrite
you don't understand sometimes yeah I act I act out
I can a little arrogant sometimes but you have to
understand that this is sort of just drama for fun
for entertainment for you guys cuz this is a show
this is a show this is a TV show right
but when I'm actually doing this work I am the
most radically open-minded one of the most radical open-minded people
probably on this whole [ __ ] planet and I
am deeply epistemic ly humble which means that despite all
of the arrogant things that I might say at times
on the inside I'm always questioning myself always always I'm
always looking for ways I could be deceiving myself always
I'm always looking for self bias as always and it's
my having done that for some 20 years since I
was a teenager since high school I've been doing this
and really like take this is my religion open-mindedness is
my religion and questioning myself and my self biases this
is my religion I've done it so much that it's
taken me to levels of understanding of reality which are
unspeakable and on communicable and that's not because I can't
speak it but because nobody can understand it whose mind
is not as open as mine has been see and
I'm not saying this to brag or to put myself
on a pedestal or anything you're capable of being open-minded
you just don't understand how important it is you take
it for granted you think this open mining this stuff
is just some sort of you know cute talk or
whatever but this I'm dead serious about this one of
the biggest things that's keeping you from Awakening and understanding
reality is simply your mind is not open enough and
that's one of the biggest things that will hold you
back with psychedelics your just your mind is not open
enough infinite open-mindedness is what you need and that's what
I ask of you if you're gonna be really following
along with me and really I'm not interested at this
point in my career to be appealing to the masses
and to be trying to convince every fool out there
clicking through one of my videos randomly of the things
that I talk about because the things that I talk
about are way beyond conventional human comprehension you have to
be serious about this work to be able to understand
the things that I want to teach and I'm passion
about teaching deep topics which is why my videos are
so damn long so that requires a certain commitment from
you if you're gonna be following with me you got
to be serious find the reasons that you need to
find to get serious about this work this is life
and death here there is no more powerful work in
in the universe that you can do than this work
that we're doing to understand the very core of reality
and the core of who you are and why you're
here and there are definitive answers to these questions this
is not theory and armchair philosophy the way they do
in universities this work if you follow along with me
and you carefully do the work and you're very open-minded
and you use some of these techniques and tools that
I teach about you will have a level of understanding
of reality that is deeper than any academic any scientist
I don't care how reputable they are any intellectual that's
what's possible here but not only that you won't just
have dry knowledge like some Nobel laureate it's gonna deeply
touch your heart it's gonna deeply transform your whole life
your whole mind everything it's gonna touch all of your
relationships it's gonna touch your career it's gonna touch how
you speak how you emot-- how you feel your health
everything will be touched by this and in a positive
way if you do it correctly but also you have
to be very careful because there's a lot of potential
for self-deception and there are many traps along the way
so what I require of my audience is maturity seriousness
curiosity open-mindedness fearlessness a desire to explore willingness to do
hard work and not just to sit there on your
ass watching videos or listening to some podcasts but doing
work meditation retreats maybe psychedelics maybe some breathing techniques maybe
some visualization techniques whatever I'm reaching levels of understanding of
reality which are gonna go over most people's heads 99%
of people even those who watch my content and I
will outgrow you if you don't grow along with me
I've already outgrown probably a majority of my audience from
where I started a lot of people these days comment
under my newest content saying that I'm crazy that I've
lost my mind that have gone off the deep end
that I'm a demon that I'm a devil whatever that
they want me to go back to teaching all the
material that this material isn't practical anymore but I told
you I told you early on that the whole point
of this work is that we're growing and if I'm
doing this work and I'm massively growing and you're not
doing the work and you're not growing that means I'm
gonna leave you in the dust so brag it's just
it means that I'm gonna be speaking from a different
reality than you I'm gonna be inhabiting a different reality
than you and I'm gonna be telling you about things
that are gonna seem crazy to you but that's because
you're in old reality you haven't been doing the work
you've been slacking off you're just sitting around watching videos
digging around online so of course of course you're not
gonna and then the only the only recourse you're gonna
have is to call me a devil or to call
me insane or whatever yeah because either you're gonna come
along on this journey with me or you're gonna you're
gonna deny that this journey exists because you can't admit
that this journey exists and all these possibilities that I
talked about exist and then at the same time just
sit back and do nothing see you're your soul is
not gonna tolerate that your soul is these are gonna
go on this journey and actually actualize some of this
stuff and validate it for yourself or you're gonna become
a troll and you're gonna say oh Leo's just full
of himself he's just a [ __ ] or he's
just a scam artist he's just one of these fake
gurus like always he's just starting a cult yeah those
are the excuses you will make when you're not doing
the work but those of you who do the work
I receive messages from you periodically glowing messages about how
your life has been transformed and your eyes have been
open to new possibilities and that's that's what I live
for that's the greatest reward for the work that I
do it's not the money it's the impact that I
know that I can have on a few of you
so I hope that you are one of those few
one out of the millions you I hope you that
I'm talking to right now that you will hear these
words that you will arise from your slumber roll up
your sleeves get to work and then one day you
will experience some of the wacky stuff that I talked
about and you'll discover how amazing it is and then
you'll also understand why this stuff is so hidden from
the majority of mankind because they're not open-minded enough they're
not willing to do the work but we also have
a lot more foundational topics to discuss so stick with
me for the future you
