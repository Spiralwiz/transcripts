hey this is Leo for actualised org and this video
is part of the blueprint series over 100 of the
greatest personal development concepts of all time and this concept
that we're covering today is what I call top 5
feelings so let's cover what this is and why it's
important and then go into some of the details here
because this is a really important concept so top 5
feelings what is that in a nutshell basically top 5
feelings means that you're gonna sit down and you are
going to articulate the top 5 feelings that you want
to consistently be feeling in your life on a our
our minutes a minute day to day basis you're going
to articulate that and then you're gonna look and ask
yourself how you can set up your circumstances so that
you're getting more of those feelings that's basically what this
concept is it's pretty simple as for why it's important
it's extremely important the reason it's important is because we
as a society are always about chasing something and it's
usually about chasing blame right we are out there and
we're looking for something that we want so when we're
setting goals for ourselves there's just this tendency to set
a goal for material things and even if they're not
material things they're still things and they're not feelings and
what ends up happening is that if you are chasing
things whether material or even spiritual you end up getting
disappointed because you end up getting that thing but then
you're still not fulfilled and that's because what you really
care about is how you feel but what you're chasing
is not a feeling and so there's a disconnect there
because what happens is that you're implicitly going after feelings
and you assume that the thing that you're going after
is gonna give you that hit of feeling that you
want but it doesn't so it's important to get that
issue resolved right off the bat so you don't spend
months and potentially years chasing after goals that ultimately are
not going to make you feel the way you want
to feel so let's go into the body of this
concept and really talk about what I mean here so
ultimately look people set goals for themselves right so what
are some common goals that people said very common goal
to look better to lose weight another common goal to
start a business another common goal to have a million
dollars in your bank account to have a nice car
and a nice house to have a nice relationship to
have cool friends to live in Hawaii whatever your goal
is all those goals are great and you should be
setting goals like that for yourself I have nothing against
materialistic goals and there are even kind of s'more spiritual
and abstract goals so maybe the goal of doing more
meditation or the goal of doing keeping a gratitude journal
or the goal of stopping negative thinking and stop being
judging and criticizing other people so these are nice goals
too I'd say that the spiritual goals are one step
up above the purely materialistic goals but there is the
next level and that is looking at how you actually
want to feel so the key question is here how
do you want to feel how do you want to
feel consistently right now I want you to really get
yourself to think about how you feel on a typical
day you know you wake up in the morning you
go through your routine you have breakfast you go to
work you do that lunchtime comes by after lunchtime you
do some more work then you come home you spend
time with your family or whatever it is that you're
doing whatever that routine is for you on a typical
day I want you to look at it and see
what are you feeling actually there and how happy are
you with those feelings and then of course the next
question is how do you want it to be right
because if what you're feeling on a consistent basis every
hour in your body I'm talking about how you actually
feel in your body and in your mind if you're
not getting the kind of emotions that you want then
the question is why is that and what kind of
emotions do you want to be getting and those external
goals that you're setting for yourself that house that money
that business that relationship is it ultimately going to get
you what you want so when we're designing your goals
I always want to track it back to what's core
and what's core is how you want to feel and
for me that's the top five feelings and what I
have is I have a feeling survey that I kind
of designed myself it's nothing fancy it's very simple just
a couple of questions really four questions that you're gonna
ask yourself that will help you identify this all right
and I'm gonna list it down below in the article
and I'm actually gonna have a little worksheet that you
can download and go through this exercise but what I
want here is I want for you to go through
this survey and figure out what are the most important
feelings for you because when I was going through this
it was a real revelation for me to understand that
if I want fulfillment and if I want my goals
to match up with fulfillment that means that when I'm
actually successful and I think that I'm successful I'm also
going to actually be fulfilled which is a rare thing
because a lot of times people will accomplish a goal
but still be unfulfilled then I got to really understand
how I want to feel and for me I sat
down and I thought about it and the feelings that
I came up with were really a list of few
and I can't put about seven of them and I'm
still trying to figure out which ones are the most
important for me I'm gonna narrow them down to five
that's what I want you to do for me my
list of feelings are I want to feel optimistic I
want to feel proud I want to feel energetic I
want to feel conscious I want to feel I want
to feel confident I want to feel strong and I
want to feel tranquil so those are just some of
the feelings personally that for me are important like when
I imagine the ideal day for me if I could
have all those feelings and I could feel that consistently
24/7 or at least the times that I'm awake then
to me that's like the ideal life and so that's
it for me and I had to sit down I
had to go through a whole list of different feelings
to find the ones that resonated the most with me
and those might change you might get better a better
sense of how to articulate that so I just want
to throw that out there as an example so you
know something concrete that you can you can use to
then abstract away and get your specifics so another list
that I'm gonna give you I'm you know I'm just
gonna throw out some feelings so that you have a
sense of what I mean by feelings so all those
that I mentioned you might other mention other feelings you
might want to be happy happiness might be important to
you or you might want to feel fun maybe you
want to feel adventurous you like feeling adventurous maybe you
want to feel bold maybe you want to feel very
present and in the moment maybe that's what what makes
you really satisfied maybe you want to feel excited I
know excitement is definitely a big one for me actually
I think it is on my list and I might
have forgotten to mention it but excitement is a big
one you know for me also that feeling of high
consciousness I love that I also love having the feeling
of creative contribution so for me that dovetails with pride
that feeling of pride that I get when I know
that I've been I've been doing something good and I've
been sharing that with others I've been making other people
feel good and I've just been contributing that gives me
a sense of pride or pride in the fact that
I'm living my life well or I'm living in alignment
with my values so that's another feeling so these are
just some ideas you can probably go and make a
really long list of of items and then come to
go down and kind of cross out the ones that
are not that important to you and circle the ones
that are very important to you in fact maybe I'll
create a worksheet like that where you can go through
there and just pick off a list but you can
also come up with your own and basically you want
to winnow that down to a list of five right
and this is how you want to consistently feel maybe
you want to think back into the past about some
of the best times in your life some of the
best memories that you have because what that will trigger
in you is memories of feelings back if you do
it vividly enough you could probably rekindle those feelings at
least a little bit within yourself you can get a
taste for it you know what are the times when
you were the happiest in your life what were you
feeling then what were the circumstances was it you spending
time with your family and you a certain sense of
connection or maybe you were feeling loved in an intimate
relationship or maybe you were at work and you were
killing it and you were you were doing something bold
and challenging and you were on your edge and you
liked that sense of exhilaration or maybe you were skydiving
and you had that sense of adventure and something doing
something risky and crazy and you like that kind of
feeling where you've got that adrenaline rush and that's what
turns you on so this going to be different for
everybody of course I want you to think back about
your own best memories and think about what what triggers
the most fond memories for you the most fond feelings
and then jot down some notes on that but the
survey so let's go into the feeling survey this appealing
survey is gonna have really four questions the first question
is what do you want to feel consistently and these
are gonna be five things I really want you to
be concise here and just say five give me five
words right so it might be something like excitement I
want if you look assignment I want to feel proud
I want to feel adventurous and I want to feel
calm and I want to feel strong something like that
come up with a list if you can't decide quite
on what you want to feel start somewhere start right
now this is usually a process that requires some introspection
and it's not going to just happen in one sitting
you're gonna sit down you're gonna you're gonna massage this
list but you want to start somewhere so you start
with a rough draft and then you can get it
to meet better in the future let's start with the
rough draft the second question that you want to ask
yourself and you should be running down these answers as
you're asking these questions is what feelings don't you want
to feel this one is probably pretty easy for you
again go through your current day and ask yourself if
you're not very fulfilled already then this will be very
easy go through your typical day or typical week and
ask yourself what kind of feelings give you the most
stress and what kind of feelings do you really avoid
the most and that you really hate right maybe you
really don't like feeling alone maybe that one is one
that you really don't like maybe you really don't like
feeling stressed and overwhelmed maybe you don't like feeling angry
maybe you don't like feeling sad maybe you don't like
feeling what else is out there feeling other other feelings
maybe you don't like feeling frustrated you know whatever it
is for you so think about that that should be
a pretty easy list come up with again i buyed
say keep it to 5 5 short words for the
feelings that you don't want that's going to be the
second part of this feeling survey and then once you
have this once you have the 5 that you do
want and the 5 that you don't want then the
third part of the survey is I want you to
go through and I want you to rate yourself on
on each of the positive 5 ones and the negative
5 ones so rate yourself on a scale of one
to ten one being that you're not feeling this right
now very consistently throughout your week and ten being that
you're feeling this feeling all the time so as an
example let's say you want to feel proud and that's
one of your positive ones right how proud are you
feeling throughout the week on a consistent basis and we're
talking about consistency so the more consistently you feel this
the more fulfilled you're going to be and basically happy
you're gonna be with your life as a whole so
do you feel proud every day do you feel proud
only for five minutes a week you know if you
only feel proud very very rarely then give yourself a
one if you feel proud all the time basically multiple
times throughout the day every single day if you're feeling
that then give yourself a 9 or 10 that means
you've got that one nailed down really well go through
and do that with all your five positive ones and
then go ahead and do the same with the negative
ones so let's say that you don't like feeling stressed
well how much stress do you have right now on
a scale of one to ten you have a stress
every single hour of every single day and then give
yourself a really high score if you are not feeling
stressed very often then give yourself a low score one
or two or something in between and do that for
the rest of the negative ones so this is going
to be a check-in because right now you probably have
not sat down quantified really what you're actually feeling in
your life both the positive and the negative and until
you do this I found with myself this can be
very enlightening to do this because right now you're going
through your day and you're not quite sure why you
just have some sort of dissatisfaction you're not happy with
your life you think that you have could have more
but it's difficult to pinpoint exactly why that is you
don't know the causes when you sit down and you
look at the feelings all of a sudden it becomes
pretty clear you get a start start picture you're like
oh I'm stressed all the time at stress at a
10 and you know what I'm feeling lonely all the
time - and beyond that I'm always angry - so
yeah if you're feeling angry and stressed and lonely all
the time and then on the flip side you're not
feeling the feelings that you want you're not feeling tranquil
you're not feeling proud you're not feeling excited the way
you want then yeah you're going to be satisfied with
your life and it's going to be obvious where exactly
the dissatisfaction is happening so that's the third part of
this survey and then of course the final part is
really the solutions part and this is asking yourself the
key question which is what changes now can you actually
make in your life practical changes habitual changes that will
increase the positive feelings and decrease the negative feelings what
is that for you it's going to be totally different
for everybody so you know pride if you want to
feel proud for me personally pride is tied to my
sense of work so for me I feel proud when
I have a strong work day and I put in
you know I give my work day the best that
I can and I produce some good results and so
for me for example when I found when I did
this exercise that I wasn't getting enough sense of pride
what I found was that that was happening on the
days when I really wasn't putting in a good work
effort and I wasn't really producing anything I wasn't creating
anything for me being creative is very important it's tied
to my sense of pride it's tied to my sense
of fulfillment in life so that means that I need
to go out now and try to rework my schedule
a little bit so that I have more time to
actually focus in and do the work personally find that
when I have a frantic day and I have to
do with million different things that I'm always multitasking I
can't focus and actually produce something that day I don't
feel proud I don't feel like I've accomplished anything and
therefore I don't feel very fulfilled that day whereas on
the flip side when I do have that moment where
I can sit down and just focus and concentrate for
a good five-hour stretch and get some something produced get
an article written shoot a video read a nice book
whatever do some journaling do some meditation when I can
do some of that stuff then I feel like I've
accomplished something I feel proud I feel fulfilled and so
for me it became really obvious when I did this
exercise that wow I need to spend more time focusing
and not doing so much multitasking and that was one
way that I could improve the point about pride and
I did that for the rest of my feelings you
know excitement how can I get more excitement in my
life I felt like I wasn't getting that much excitement
so for me that meant I have to do maybe
some things that are a little bit out of the
ordinary that are out of my routine maybe I should
be taking more trips on the weekends I like taking
trips but I usually don't have enough time to do
them because I'm running through my routine I'm so busy
with work and this and that and stuff that I
need to be following up on sometimes it becomes a
little too tedious and I feel like my life is
just going down a very kind of straight-laced trajectory sometimes
I need to switch that up and do something exciting
something that's off my schedule and so I find that
when I get that sense of excitement it's with something
whoa and I'm doing something new so getting out there
and doing more activities doing more new activities with my
friends doing more activities by myself maybe going out there
and doing things that are not at the top of
my goals list because it's up that's up up top
my goals list I do that all the time and
I'm usually keeping up with it but there's also a
little minor things at the bottom of my list like
maybe cooking a new recipe or learning to play a
new instrument or maybe reading a book that's not related
to my work usually most of the books I read
are personal development related but maybe reading a book that's
like a biography or something more tangential something a bit
more adventurous and different so for me those are a
couple of examples of the positive ones and negative examples
stuff that I don't like feeling you know I don't
I definitely don't like feeling stressed I don't like feeling
angry and so I'll look and I'll see in my
in my weekly schedule I'll just see where am I
feeling angry what's causing me to feel like you're you
what's causing me to feel stressed and therefore from this
list by asking that key final question on the survey
you know what changes can actually make to increase the
positive and decrease the negative feelings that is where you
get your action plan because you're gonna get one you
can you can get I recommend just doing one point
of action that you can take on each one of
these one point on each positive feeling so you could
have five points there and then five action points on
each negative feeling and then that's your list that basically
tells you what your goals should be now look at
how the goals that were generated with this process are
different than the goals that would have been generated if
I if you just sat down I said you know
what it would are one of the ten dream things
that you want your life you're probably gonna say an
Icehouse certain amount of money in your bank account etc
etc right but here it's gonna be different these goals
are gonna be a little bit more abstract but they're
also going to really connect with your fulfillment this process
guarantees that the connection is there because you know what
now I know that if I spend more time focusing
on work I'm gonna feel proud that's gonna increase my
fulfillment directly it's not going to be some indirect relationship
and also I know that if I go out and
I take a road trip during the weekend and do
something new do something a little bit of adventurous that's
going to make me feel excited and therefore that's gonna
directly impact my fulfillment direct relationship and same thing with
the negative ones so that's exactly what I want for
you is I want you to generate this list of
goals and see how they compare see if there are
any surprises on this list I know when I did
this exercise they're definitely a couple of surprises and I
immediately saw that oh if I just focus and just
pick one point I don't even need to implement all
ten points if I just pick one of these action
items and I go out and I shift my the
following week and I do things just a little bit
differently so that I'm looking and at one point that
I can already see how much better I'm gonna feel
about myself and therefore I'm gonna be happier so this
is a process really of increasing happiness in your life
pretty cool huh it's a powerful process very simple don't
underestimate its impact so go through do this feeling survey
once you do it you're gonna have the top 5
feelings and what I want you to do if you're
following along with the blueprint and you have a personal
mission statement as of course you should write down these
top five feelings in your personal mission statement because this
is something that's gonna stick with you really for the
rest of your life you want to keep reminding yourself
every morning for a few minutes just what it is
that you want to be feeling and there are multiple
ways that you can use this first of all you
can use this to see if the goals that you're
pursuing are actually in alignment with the feelings that you
want because sometimes they'll be out of alignment right maybe
right now what you're pursuing is you're pursuing a new
business and you think that what you really want is
a new business and so you're working really hard at
it and it's stressing you out you're spending a lot
of time doing that but really the top feeling that
you want to be feeling is maybe something like love
or the top feeling that you want to be feeling
is you want to be feeling something like adventure and
maybe your business is not really giving you much adventure
maybe there's a more direct route to adventure than starting
a business maybe the more direct route is taking road
trips with your spouse on the weekends and therefore you
satisfy both the love and the adventure feelings and you're
not spending so much time building a business which is
getting you what it might be getting money you might
be getting you other things which could be good but
maybe they're just not that important to you right now
maybe they're not a priority so this is a way
to look at the tangible goals that you set your
for yourself and seeing if they really align so that's
a really powerful way to use this another way to
use this that I talked about in other blueprint videos
is to kind of force your mood I have this
idea that I took from Brendon Burchard and he talked
about the idea that mood is not something that should
be happening to you but something that you should be
enforcing on yourself and on the external world so these
top five feelings are a way to do that because
now you have targets for what you want your mood
to be right when I wake up in the morning
I can tell myself I want to feel proud I
want to feel excited I want to feel tranquil and
I can force those moods on myself just by thinking
about certain things and using various mental techniques that we
talked about in other videos so that can be another
powerful way to use it I want you to be
very familiar with the feelings that you want to feel
because all the goals that are going to be doing
and all the goals are gonna be setting for years
and years to come should really be coming through and
you should be filtering first through your filter of feelings
and then you can have the external goals that you
have and those are great but anyways this is going
to wrap it up here go ahead and share your
comments do this exercise should be quick and easy one
I'm gonna have worksheets down below and the article that
you can you can download makes things even easier for
you and then go ahead and share your comments what
are your top five feelings the positive ones and then
also the negative ones how consistently are you following up
on those and then of course if you find this
valuable and you do this exercise share with a friend
send them here so that they can also benefit from
from this exercise alright this is Leo signing off you
