            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/hPOr4HU_IhY' target='_blank'>Assumption Is The Mother Of All Fuck-Ups</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Assumption, Epistemology, and Survival</b>: Leo Gura discusses assumptions and their crucial role within epistemology. He states that survival has forced a devils bargain of utility over truth as actions required for survival lead to making assumptions about reality. These assumptions allow for short-term action, providing immediate utility but sacrificing long-term truth. Given that humans have limited knowledge and are in a continuous position of ignorance, assumptions become critical for survival as they help simplify complex situations and direct activities. However, he highlights that this process comes with the risk of self-deception, epistemic errors, and untruthfulness.
</li><li><b>Connection between Survival and Assumptions</b>: Emphasizing the interplay between survival and assumptions, Leo points out that existing survival pressures, including those experienced by successful individuals, lead to a rationalization that assumptions equate to truth, solely based on their utility. This, in turn, can lead to individuals overlooking the inherent fallibility of their assumptions, constituting a significant trap for most people who are struggling with survival pressures.
</li><li><b>Existential Uncertainty and Utility of Assumptions</b>: Leo emphasizes existential uncertainty and the inherent lack of omniscience in humans. We require immediate action for survival but lack perfect information about any situation, which necessitates the making of assumptions. He argues that the utility acquired from these assumptions often prevents individuals from questioning their validity, leading to long-term epistemic errors.
</li><li><b>Falsehoods of Success and Truth</b>: According to Leo, humans tend to wrongly equate success with truth, owing to the survival utility derived from their assumptions. Disproving this perception, he argues that individuals might see success precisely because they are misaligned with truth. As such, he distinguishes between the attainment of material gains and aligning oneself with the truth, noting that the two do not always go hand in hand.
</li><li><b>High Prevalence of Assumptions</b>: Leo notes that we hold and use numerous assumptions everyday to navigate life, ranging from simple to abstract, metaphysical ones. While many of these assumptions generally hold true, they sometimes fail or lead to detrimental outcomes. It is critical to recognize these assumptions and their potential downsides in various aspects of life like relationships, health, finance, science, etc., to ensure they align with reality and prevent them from causing significant harm.
</li><li><b>The myth of science and assumptions made</b>: Leo discusses how science is often held as the epitome of truth due to its utility and effectiveness. Despite this, he emphasizes that science relies heavily on assumptions to maintain utility, which can lead to incorrect beliefs if unexamined. For example, despite nutrition sciences' pivotal role in our health, many of its research findings can be quite unreliable due to the multitude of assumptions made.
</li><li><b>The consequences of false assumptions</b>: He warns against uncritically accepting the accuracy of scientific findings, as false assumptions can have severe consequences, affecting our emotional well-being and practical areas of life like business, health, and spiritual growth. Leo argues that these epistemic errors stem from a deeper problem where false assumptions can infiltrate any worldview, including religions, philosophies, economics, and politics.
</li><li><b>Survival trumps rationality</b>: In this section, Leo asserts that survival trumps logic and rationality. He points out that survival instincts are quicker than logical reasoning, making emotional responses vital for immediate reaction in critical life situations. This, he argues, shows why survival co-opts our reasoning process and should make us wary of conflating truth and rationality.
</li><li><b>Academic philosophy and survival concerns</b>: Leo discusses his criticism of academic philosophy for distancing itself from survival concerns, making it oblivious to the reality of existence. He suggests that deep, profound questions cannot be answered from an armchair and require putting one's survival on the line.
</li><li><b>The importance of questioning assumptions</b>: Leo concludes by stressing the necessity of questioning assumptions, even as they appear to work on the surface. This is because the assumption that questioning doesn't improve the material quality of our lives is itself a meta-assumption. Meanwhile, avoiding the process would lead to paralysis, given that survival can't afford luxuries like waiting for proof. 
</li><li><b>The paradox of assumptions</b>: With regards to assumptions, Leo presents a paradox: they are necessary for survival yet open us up to potential self-deception. He attributes the need for assumptions to our finite minds operating within an infinite reality. This ultimate quandary hints at the necessity to continuously question and examine our assumptions.
</li><li><b>Assumptions are rooted in survival and limited knowledge</b>: Leo explains that assumptions are made because human beings are not omniscient and have a bias towards survival. If we were omniscient or didn't care about survival, we wouldn't need to make assumptions. However, evolving into a being that is omniscient and unconcerned with survival would fundamentally change our lives and consciousness.
</li><li><b>Unearthing and questioning implicit and hidden assumptions can be challenging but necessary</b>: These assumptions are often culturally acquired and become part of an unquestioned epistemic background. Noticing and challenging these assumptions can be emotionally unsettling, as we've often built our lives on a foundation of these perceptions. 
</li><li><b>Contemplating assumptions within fields of knowledge</b>: Leo urges scientists, researchers, and individuals in general to take time to deeply contemplate the assumptions at the foundation of their field. Understanding these foundational beliefs can enable groundbreaking research and discoveries.
</li><li><b>Test the use of assumptions in daily life</b>: Leo suggests practical experiments to understand the role of assumptions in day-to-day life. For example, he encourages viewers to try to make decisions and interact in various life situations without making assumptions, and to then reflect on the outcomes.
</li><li><b>The cost of false assumptions and collective fictions</b>: Perpetuating unrealistic assumptions can lead to emotional disturbance and practical problems as realities reveal erroneous thinking. For example, a person who becomes a doctor under false assumptions about wealth and happiness might ultimately face dissatisfaction and potentially, an existential crisis. Career decisions, personal choices, and lifestyle can be heavily influenced by society's collective fictions.
</li><li><b>Meta assumptions shape our worldview</b>: Meta assumptions are overarching assumptions about our assumptions. They are usually a part of our epistemological framework that informs our thinking about any situation. Questioning these deep-seated assumptions can unravel a larger worldview and open up new possibilities.
</li><li><b>Questioning assumptions can lead to profound realizations</b>: Leo encourages viewers to continually question their assumptions and beliefs. Overturning deep-seated assumptions can lead to significant paradigm shifts and expanded views of reality. This work involves exhaustive questioning for new insights that go beyond ordinary thinking.
</li><li><b>Assumptions and Career Choices</b>: Many professionals, like doctors for example, make assumptions about their career paths leading to helping people or bringing happiness. Once entrenched in their fields, they may realize that the realities of the industry don't align with their expectations, leading to dissatisfaction or even depression. 
</li><li><b>Assumptions and Material Wealth</b>: There's a common assumption that material wealth and status lead to happiness. However, many people who acquire wealth and status find that they're still not happy, leading them to question why they pursued these things in the first place.
</li><li><b>Assumptions in Science</b>: Many scientists make unquestioned metaphysical and epistemic assumptions, leading to potentially flawed science. Good science should involve questioning these assumptions, but this is often neglected due to biases against philosophy and metaphysics in the scientific community.
</li><li><b>Role of Selflessness in Questioning Assumptions</b>: Questioning the deepest and most important assumptions requires selflessness, as these assumptions often form the basis of one's sense of self. Challenging these can lead to existential crises and can be threatening.
</li><li><b>Assumptions in Different Domains</b>: Assumptions exist in every domain, from science, atheism, and relationships, to politics, economics, health, and personal beliefs. Identifying and questioning these is critical. 
</li><li><b>Assumptions in Philosophy and Religion</b>: Assumptions are prevalent in every philosophical system or religious belief. It's essential to question these assumptions to avoid getting trapped in a particular worldview or ideology.
</li><li><b>Cultural Assumptions</b>: Culture imprints assumptions onto individuals, and these can be absorbed unconsciously and uncritically. Starting to challenge and question these assumptions can yield significant personal growth.
</li><li><b>Following Non-Dual Teachings Blindly</b>: It can be a mistake to assume that non-dual teachings don't have assumptions. Just like any other domain, non-dual teachings should be questioned to uncover underlying assumptions.
</li><li><b>Assumptions in Business and Personal Development</b>: Assumptions infiltrate the fields of business, career choices, and personal development, influencing decision-making significantly. It's important to recognize and question these assumptions.
</li><li><b>Assumptions in cultural domains</b>: Assumptions are adopted in various cultural domains such as religion, business, science, philosophy, art, morality, sexuality, nutrition, and relationships. Many of these beliefs are absorbed from the culture and are rarely questioned.
</li><li><b>Assumptions in practise</b>: Articulating and identifying assumptions can be a complex process, but they are usually simple and clearly defined once discovered. Noticing these assumptions allows one to step outside of them and gain more awareness.
</li><li><b>Examples of everyday assumptions</b>: Examples include assuming a clock shows correct time or the person you're texting is alive. When these assumptions are proven wrong, it can result in surprise or confusion. The divergence from the mental model of reality can have substantial consequences.
</li><li><b>Effect of misunderstandings</b>: Assumptions on others' understanding can be harmful, as demonstrated through a hypothetical hiring situation where an employee misunderstands job requirements leading to negative impact on Leo's business.
</li><li><b>Potential harmful assumptions</b>: Assumptions can result in disastrous outcomes in different situations, like assuming investments will pay off, business plans will work, food won't be disliked before trying it, the news read is correct, or trusting the waiter didn't spit in food.
</li><li><b>Assumptions in business</b>: Faulty assumptions made in business can lead to bankruptcy, while clarity in communication and understanding can prevent these mistakes and improve success.
</li><li><b>Incorrect assumptions</b>: Incorrect assumptions can come from believing misconceptions, like eating fat makes one fat, or trusting a sexual partner will not transmit an STD, or expecting insurance to cover all losses.
</li><li><b>Personal assumptions about oneself</b>: Negative self-perceptions, like assuming one is too short or ugly to attract a partner, can be detrimental and should be questioned.
</li><li><b>Assumptions about happiness</b>: Assuming certain things or states (money, car, house, sex, drugs) will lead to happiness is an example of a common assumption that may not necessarily hold true.
</li><li><b>Assumptions and Perception of Good and Bad</b>: Leo Gura notes that assumptions shape our perception of phenomena as good or bad. For example, corruption is perceived as good by those who profit from it and hence it persists. Similarly, activities like polluting or owning a gun may be perceived as beneficial despite their harmful realities due to underlying assumptions.
</li><li><b>Assumptions in Science and Health</b>: Assumptions also extend to accepting scientific studies and health advice at face value, without considering their validity. There is a habit of taking scientific studies as accurate, ignoring that a significant proportion of published studies are later contradicted or invalid.
</li><li><b>Religious Assumptions</b>: In religion, assumptions play a crucial role. For Christians, the belief in the existence of Jesus Christ is a fundamentally unquestioned assumption. For believers, acknowledging this belief as an assumption is often too threatening to their worldview.
</li><li><b>Assumptions in Daily Life</b>: Everyday actions, such as eating food, involve countless assumptions regarding safety, healthiness, and quality. These assumptions are automatic and rarely consciously considered.
</li><li><b>Meta Assumptions</b>: Meta assumptions, or assumptions about our own assumptions, have a profound influence on our lives. For example, we assume our religion is true or, conversely, that all religions are false. This layer of assumptions manipulates our worldview without us consciously realizing it.
</li><li><b>Questioning Assumptions</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of questioning every assumption, even deeply ingrained ones like our human identity, object permanence, and the physical reality of the world. This questioning may lead us to challenge several beliefs in science, philosophy, and spirituality. 
</li><li><b>Assumptions about Experts and Expertise</b>: Leo critiques the habit of assuming that experts, including scientists or professional authorities, are infallible. By doing so, we overestimate their credibility, potentially resulting in misleading or flawed conclusions.
</li><li><b>Assumptions about Consciousness and Reality</b>: There is a prevailing trend to make assumptions about consciousness and reality including the belief that mind arises from the brain or that physical pain validates the existence of an object or occurrence. These assumptions, while widely accepted, are not verifiable.
</li><li><b>Assumptions About Truth and Knowledge</b>: Leo Gura reveals the common assumptions about truth, such as the idea that truth can be taught or communicated or that science is the best methodology for acquiring truth. He challenges these notions, arguing that most truths are neither communicable nor logically proven through scientific methods. He encourages a skepticism towards generalized assumptions like truth being logical and rational, or truth equating with something that works.
</li><li><b>Intersect of Science and Reality</b>: Leo delves into the concept that reality may not be as finite as we assume. He explores more mystical, infinite theories that contradict many scientific principles, advocating a holistic rather than reductionistic view of reality. Leo addresses widely-held assumptions including that science can explain and demystify all of reality, the differentiation between mind and body, and the objectivity of science and mathematics.
</li><li><b>Assumptions in Spirituality and Religion</b>: Leo warns of the dangers of unquestioned faith in religious dogma, a guru, or an enlightened master. He problematizes the idea that meditation is universally productive for all individuals seeking spiritual growth. Assumptions related to the nature of God and the accuracy of religious texts like the Bible or the Quran are also highlighted.
</li><li><b>Mystical Assumptions</b>: The lecture traverses various mystical perspectives and assumptions, like the existence of a higher power, the legitimacy of miracles, the reality of spiritual and paranormal events, and the validity of previously dismissive subjects (termed "woo"). He questions unspecified assumptions about consciousness and the reality of the self.
</li><li><b>Self-Deception and Assumptions</b>: Leo alerts his audience to the pitfalls of self-deception and the misleading nature of personal thoughts. He suggests that assumptions about one's own authenticity and truthfulness might lead individuals to misconstrue situations or realities. He emphasizes that assumptions can heavily influence people's interpretation of data and their overall ability to continue exploration and questioning.
</li><li><b>Application in Practical Life Areas</b>: Leo highlights the importance of avoiding assumptions in various arenas of life, such as business. He suggests being more open-minded and clear in communication during processes like hiring and marketing. He highlights examples of flawed assumptions, including that an agreed-upon plan aligns with a common goal, as well as the assumed outcomes of marketing strategies.
</li><li><b>Assumptions About Self and Personal Growth</b>: Gura warns against the assumption that certain milestones mark the end of self-improvement or spiritual growth. He suggests that questioning one's growth processes can reveal deeper levels of awakening, leading to further personal expansion.
</li><li><b>Importance of Testing Business Assumptions</b>: Leo Gura emphasises the importance of testing business assumptions, particularly in marketing. He advises companies to diversify their strategies and test different avenues for customer acquisition rather than depending on a single method. He clarifies that while projection and planning are essential, they are grounded in assumptions that must be tested and validated.
</li><li><b>Assumptions in Major Purchasing and Investment Decisions</b>: Leo further discusses the role of assumptions in significant purchasing decisions and investment strategies, giving the example of the cryptocurrency trend. He stresses the need for caution and balance when making investment decisions, suggesting that assumptions about constant growth could lead to financial loss if not appropriately managed.
</li><li><b>Assumptions in Attraction, Dating, and Sexuality</b>: Leo discusses how assumptions can impact ones romantic and sexual relationships. He notes how individuals often make incorrect assumptions about what others find attractive or assume someone else's intentions. He also mentions how personal preferences vary greatly and emphasizes the importance of communication in romantic and sexual situations.
</li><li><b>Importance of Conscious communication in Relationships</b>: In the context of long-term relationships, Leo emphasises the importance of clear and conscious communication. He acknowledges that assumptions often hinder effective communication, suggesting that partners should regularly check they're on the same page to minimize misunderstandings.
</li><li><b>Assumptions about Health</b>: Lastly, Leo discusses the role of assumptions in our healthcare, suggesting that it is important to question diagnoses and advice from doctors. He expresses that assumptions about health can lead to significant consequences and recommends considering multiple perspectives when managing health problems.
</li><li><b>Health Problems and Assumptions</b>: Leo Gura shares his personal health issues where he had to make several assumptions regarding his condition and treatment. He highlights that those assumptions turned out to be wrong, demonstrating the importance of cautious and non-ideological approaches when dealing with health problems. He recalled assuming fruits and vegetables would be healthy for his particular condition, but it worsened his situation, suggesting that challenging these ingrained assumptions could significantly help resolve health problems.
</li><li><b>Meta-Assumptions</b>:
</li><li>Leo emphasizes the concept of meta-assumptions, which he describes as assumptions about our own assumptions. He provides examples like assuming that one does not make assumptions or that the assumptions we make are not significant. Leo stresses that these meta-assumptions could profoundly influence our perception of reality and can limit our understanding of the world around us.
</li><li><b>The Nine Dot Problem</b>: Leo presents the nine dot problem as an opportunity to challenge our assumptions. The aim of the puzzle requires individuals to connect all nine dots using only four continuous straight lines. Most individuals tend to assume that they need to stay within the confines of the dots which limits their ability to solve the puzzle. The solution, however, lies outside the box, and requires challenging this implicit assumption. Leo uses this example to illustrate how similar limitations apply in real life and how reassessing our assumptions can open up new possibilities.
</li><li><b>Reality Perception and Assumptions</b>: Leo expounds on the concept that the mind and consciousness can reshape reality by imagining certain limits. He states that spiritual truths are often inaccessible to most people because they haven't questioned their fundamental assumptions deeply enough. He prompts viewers to challenge core beliefs or assumptions, such as the inevitability of death or the fixed parameters of physical reality. He insists that by questioning these deep-seated assumptions, individuals can expand their perception and understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Deep questioning and challenging assumptions</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of deep questioning and challenging one's assumptions to the point of having profound realizations. He notes the ordinary mind may dismiss this concept, categorizing it as new-age ideology or irrational thinking without understanding that it's a methodology for introspection and truth-seeking.
</li><li><b>Exercise for questioning assumptions</b>: Leo suggests an exercise where viewers list major assumptions that, in hindsight, turned out to be false. Reflecting on the impact of these false assumptions on their life can provide insight into why they held these assumptions in the first place  often due to a need or desire for them to be true.
</li><li><b>Effects of questioning assumptions</b>: Gura warns that questioning assumptions, especially those held by others, could incite negative reactions since it threatens the survival mechanisms built around these assumptions. This survival is not only personal but extends to various societal institutions such as businesses, universities, and churches that function on shared assumptions and collective egos.
</li><li><b>Consequences of collective fictions and assumptions</b>: Leo explored the phenomenon of collective fictions and assumptions in society, noting how they become increasingly powerful and meaningful when a significant number of people buy into them, despite being mere constructs. These assumptions can support entire industries and societal norms, and questioning these can evoke strong resistance and even hostility.
</li><li><b>Value of challenging assumptions and collective fictions</b>: Leo asserts that despite the potential backlash, it is crucial and beneficial to devote time and effort to questioning and dissolving these fictions and assumptions. This practice forms the core of good epistemology and deep contemplation, leading to more significant insights and understandings over time. 
</li><li><b>Continued investment in questioning assumptions</b>: While noting that revealing the simple truths behind assumptions may take a considerable time, Gura encourages constant questioning and challenging of assumptions. This practice requires a radically open mind and a commitment to persistent inquiry, which will yield valuable dividends in the long run.
