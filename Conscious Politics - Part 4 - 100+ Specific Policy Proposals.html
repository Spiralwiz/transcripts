[Music] you all right welcome to conscious politics part 4
where we will be discussing concrete conscious policy proposals this
will be the last part of this series although I
will also be speaking about various political topics in the
future as well but let's dig into this so see
conscious politics we've we've talked about the various principles and
the foundations that's all important all that theory but it's
rather abstract and it can come off as idealistic and
utopian philosophy it's very importantly understand that that's not enough
of course having the right principles foundation and theory and
the big picture understanding of how government works and what
it does for us all the historical background that's all
good that's very important but now we got to find
concrete ways of implementing all of that stuff and I'm
going to give you a large list here of items
these will be very specific policy proposals now I'm mostly
going to be talking about proposals for America because of
course you know different countries already have different systems in
place I can't possibly talk about them all but also
understand that if you're in Europe or some other country
the things that I'm talking about are aren't quite globally
applicable not just to America but to many countries around
the world some countries already have the stuff implemented and
some countries are a hundred years away from implementing some
of this stuff because they're they're nowhere there yet but
it gives you a general sense of which direction we
need to go in also keep in mind that these
proposals I'm about to give you I'm not dogmatic about
them I don't hold them firmly as some ideology that
it needs to happen I'm empirical about it so what
I'm saying is that these proposals seem like they would
work but of course we understand that as systems thinkers
you know society is a complex thing and we acknowledge
that sometimes we can be wrong about our policy ideas
and oftentimes an idea sounds good but then when you
implement it it's terrible or it backfires and does the
opposite of what you wanted it to so if any
of these proposals are implemented and they don't work the
way they're supposed to we change them we change them
to something better that's how it works so don't get
caught up in perfectionism here government is not about perfectionism
it's just about gradual incremental improvements but also at the
same time it's about systemic change all of these proposals
are going to be hitting at core issues not superficial
stuff and also some of these ideas that I'll be
offering they can be implemented immediately today in America or
some of them are gonna be quite radical and quite
advanced and it'll take 50 or 100 years before we
can implement them so I'll have a mix of both
of these right remember that one of the problems with
our politics right now is that we only think one
election cycle ahead four years ahead if even that and
that's a very bad way to plan society so some
of the stuff I'm going to be saying here is
gonna be shocking and radical but only because what I'm
looking at is a very long time horizon I'm looking
50 or 100 years into the future you see so
in that sense it's not radical and it's not each
Hope ian's just keep that in mind all right so
these are in no particular order it's a it's gonna
be a long list but this first item I think
is the one that I'm most attached to and I
think is the most important because it affects everything else
so much criminalization of money in politics and corporate lobbying
is my first proposal right now what we have especially
in America is a system of legalized bribery where corporations
and rich donors millionaires and billionaires can use their money
to influence elections and to basically manipulate the entire system
towards their advantage and that's exactly of course what they
do and knowing how survival works we can expect and
predict that that's exactly how they would behave if they're
allowed to do that so my proposal is to pass
a constitutional amendment that actually bans all money in politics
and reinforces the idea of one person one vote that
is the core idea behind democracy right now it might
seem on the surface that we have one-person one-vote because
nobody gets to actual physical vote to the ballot box
but in practice we don't the system has been so
manipulated by Devils over the last 200 years since the
country was founded that what we have in practice is
that the people with money the corporations the millionaires and
billionaires the people with the connections and the power that
they get more than one vote which is not what
the founders intended and which is what is skewing the
entire system out of balance see even though a billionaire
doesn't technically have more than one vote in practice he
does because he can use those billions of dollars to
fund political campaigns run advertisements create propaganda channels on the
internet you know fund various kinds of disinformation campaigns all
this sort of stuff create fundraisers and galas and dinners
and various kinds of fake charities and nonprofit organizations all
of this to influence politicians to get close to politicians
and to ultimately get them to pass what he wants
them to pass or to select the politicians that people
can vote on see this is a huge problem and
of course corporations are are the worst offenders here because
corporations have more money than any one individual and they
have a vested interest to rig the system but if
you think about it corporations have no vote whatsoever under
the Constitution they don't get a vote at all and
yet what we have now in America is we have
corporations mostly controlling politics so how backwards is that they're
not even supposed to have a vote and yet they
have more voting power than anybody else even though they
don't physically go to the to the ballot box what
they can do is they can run they can fund
and run these various kinds of corporate PACs dark money
coming from all sorts of sources the money has not
tracked all of this is corruption it's legalized corruption its
corruption has been so normalized that people just accept it
as how business is done in Washington this is a
huge problem and we need to get back to one-person
one-vote and we need to do this constitutionally because the
Supreme Court has made a series of quite problematic decisions
about money being free speech and this idea that you
can just hand people bags of money and do these
fundraisers and speeches and so forth and that all of
this is just free speech and it's all protected no
this is this is devilry is what this is money
is not free speech and you are not allowed to
give a bag of money to a judge or to
a police officer or to a professor to get a
good grade that's called bribery and this is exactly what's
happening within politics it's just so normalized that we don't
think of it the system is so entrenched and steeped
in this corruption in this bribery so to fix this
I think we need a constitutional amendments but it's very
clear and very strong and there's no more debate or
wishy washing us about about money and politics it just
needs to be stopped and all politics need to be
publicly financed I mean all elections need to be publicly
financed yes that cost the taxpayer some extra money but
actually this is a huge return on investment that will
get us taxpayers because right now we lose so much
tax money from all the corruption and bribery that's been
legalized all the lobbying all the corporate subsidies for the
military-industrial complex for Big Oil for pharmaceuticals all of this
sort of stuff we lose literally billions hundreds of billions
and even trillions of dollars because we don't have public
financing of Elections it's it's it's quite quite ridiculous and
obnoxious so in this way we can really clean up
government and yup funds by not wasting funds in the
wrong areas due to lobbying and various kinds of pork
projects we can free up those funds to really fund
the social projects that are necessary which I'll be talking
about as we move down the list we also need
an abolition of gerrymandering gerrymandering is an absurd absurd practice
again the Supreme Court is not doing a very good
job of cracking down on this gerrymandering goes again against
this idea of one-person one-vote you should not be able
to have more voting power than any other person in
a democracy as soon as that stops being the case
all sorts of corruption and shenanigans ensue and that's what
we have right now there is no reason why if
you own a billion dollars you should have more voting
power than someone who works at McDonald's or Starbucks yeah
that's exactly the case a billionaire right now can just
go fund his own election this should be impossible under
the new system abolition of gerrymandering you know gerrymandering is
the redrawing of district lines in such a way that
the politicians are actually picking their voters rather than the
voters picking the politicians we need to have independent counsels
of objective nonpartisan people or we can do it through
computer algorithm or whatever in order to redraw all the
district lines across the entire country such the the districts
are unbiased fair and roughly equal and even rather than
these jerry men or monstrosity x' which we see today
because that is robbing people of their voting power we
also I think need to abolish the Electoral College because
if we take a look in American politics the last
few elections especially with the election of George W Bush
and Donald Trump you know they didn't win the popular
votes not really you know people say oh well the
polls were so wrong Leo how can you trust the
polls you know Trump beat all the polls they said
he was gonna lose well actually Trump did lose he
lost by 3 million votes so we're actually not in
as bad a situation as it might seem because really
it's the electoral college that's been trippin stuff up imagine
if the election of George W Bush and Donald Trump
never happened because there was no electoral college that would
be a much better outcome no Iraq war for example
in which we lost trillions of dollars and hundreds of
thousands of needless people were killed so so yeah the
people are actually not that stupid if you actually let
their will be heard and let them vote so the
very things that the electoral college was supposed to protect
us from in the last few election cycles it actually
did the exact opposite of that and it's cost us
billions and even trillions of dollars so so all this
goes into sort of cleaning up the whole system also
we need to make voting a lot more accessible as
accessible as possible whether that means online voting or automatic
voter voter registration all of this should be possible and
made secure election day should be made a federal holiday
so that people can get to the polls the polls
need to be done in such a manner that there
aren't long lines it should take you only 15 minutes
to vote not waiting in line for four hours this
is absurd because that discourages people from voting we also
need to eliminate closed primaries and caucuses that's important because
these limit the accessibility of voting especially in the primaries
and we need stronger primaries the general elections are not
good enough we also need strong primaries the problem right
now with primaries that many states have closed primaries which
means that you have to be a registered Democrat or
Republican to vote in that primary but for example like
I live in Nevada I I want to go to
a primary and vote but I can't because I'd have
to register as a Democrat and Republican I don't really
want to register as either one of those I'm sort
of forced to if I want to participate in primaries
but it's even worse because in Nevada we have closed
caucuses which are even worse than closed primaries which means
that if I want to participate in this next primary
the Democratic one I have to go to this caucus
this caucus is some arcane process of going to some
giant convention hall with a bunch of other people and
caucusing with them literally spending hours like three or four
hours discussing the different candidates and the different issues and
then we have to convince each other who our candidate
should be like it's it's a it's a quite arcane
system that doesn't scale well to to modern times maybe
it would have worked 200 years ago but it don't
work today and it's too inaccessible for most people so
we need to replace that with just quick and simple
primary primaries and make the primaries open some states have
that and that's what we need more of we also
need a multi-party system with rank-choice voting what we have
right now in America is problematic this this two-party system
which becomes very stale and very partisan and voting for
third parties is basically impossible you're just wasting your vote
because they have no chance of winning and there's no
point in voting for them because your vote doesn't really
count towards anything in a multi-party system with the rank-choice
voting that means you can vote for different candidates even
third party candidates well uh Congress people and so forth
and there's like a legislature and then a certain percentage
of the legislature gets filled with the with the party
like the libertarian party with the Green Party whatever other
kind of party that didn't win the majority but they
still have some members in a legislature or in Congress
this would be a much better system we really need
more competition between parties no conservatives always say that competition
improves everything well how about more competition within the political
party system that would really help another cool idea I
have is we have a wonderful system in us in
the states where you can pass ballot initiatives with various
propositions every time there's a new election every couple of
years you hear this you see signs on the streets
or it's like vote Yes on Prop 55 or vote
no against prop 13 or something like that and this
is great but why is it only happening at the
state level why can't we have propositions at the federal
level this is true democracy propositions required that you get
a bunch of signatures so maybe if if you could
get a hundred thousand signatures or a million signatures for
federal propositions then that proposition will be on the ballot
next time you go to vote so you're not just
gonna be voting for a president or first senator or
congressman you're gonna be voting all these different propositions and
we can have propositions like legalizing marijuana or gun regulation
or whatever other popular ideas are out there that people
want because right now one of the problems we have
in in America is that our Congress is so gridlocked
that they don't actually bring popular issues to vote in
the Senate or in the house and this could quickly
get resolved through federal propositions because there are a lot
of issues that need to be resolved that could be
quickly resolved that are very popular that have a support
from the majority of Americans there are certain things that
like a majority of Americans would vote tomorrow to legalize
marijuana I think a majority of Americans would vote tomorrow
like over 80% or even over 90% would vote for
some kind of sensible gun regulation background checks that sort
of stuff so why isn't this stuff getting passed in
Congress well because it's so gridlocked so one way to
break through that gridlock is just let the people have
their propositions get signatures have a have a fair process
for getting these signatures and getting these propositions we also
need a ban on lobbyists holding public office this is
a huge problem right now that we have and it's
especially bad under Trump but it's always been there even
before Trump it's there even with Democrats as well although
it's certainly worse under conservatives because they don't really believe
in a strong government so what they do is they
get corporate lobbyists who Lobby the government professionally they earn
millions of dollars doing they corrupt the government by doing
this but that's not enough for them then what they
do is they get appointed by the people who win
the elections and they get appointed to various regulatory positions
in the EPA or in the Energy Department or wherever
else and then they go towards undermining and doing their
lobbying their corporate lobbying while they're serving public office and
then it gets even worse once they leave you know
once their term is over they leave after a few
years and they go back right into the same industry
the same corporation that they were lobbying for and then
they they use all the contacts that they develop with
all the politicians while they were in office to then
further grease the wheels and do even more corporate lobbying
and now they get paid even more this whole system
is is called the revolving door it's a it's a
terrible system it's it's very corrupt so what we need
is we need to ban lobbyists if you're corporate lobbyists
you're not allowed to hold public office unless you've stopped
being in corporate lobbyists maybe for 10 or 20 years
and then once you leave public office you're not allowed
to go and lobby for corporation again for another 10
or 20 years at least this would solve a lot
of these problems because this is a huge conflict of
interest and direct corruption of government right this directly undercuts
the idea of one-person one-vote nexus taxation we need significantly
higher taxation on extreme wealth because one of the biggest
problems we have and most countries have this not just
America is a widening gap between the extremely rich and
the rest of the citizens this is natural this is
what happens under capitalism when you have unchecked capitalism and
free market what happens is that you have own ever-growing
gap and the middle class basically gets eroded and this
becomes very problematic this is one of the biggest problems
for a country because then what you have is you
have this giant disparity of interests and survival agendas where
you have people who are basically barely surviving and working
two jobs just to to feed their kids and then
you have fat cats the top who are flying around
on private jets and using their money to further corrupt
the system see the problem is when you have too
much money more money than you really need for survival
and basic luxuries and stuff any money beyond that that
money tends to be squandered by egos so my proposal
is that anything over a million dollars gets taxed quite
heavily and anything over ten million or a billion dollars
gets taxed extremely heavily because these people simply don't need
that money and they're actually squandering it and they're actually
using it to corrupt the system see that money needs
to be put towards places that really need it to
help elevate other people and that overall will help to
improve society society is not improved by having one percent
of millionaires and billionaires who have all the power and
all the wealth this is this is not a healthy
society this is highly unbalanced and it creates all sorts
of problems that trickle through the whole system not only
do we need to be taxing income we need to
be also taxing wealth because a lot of these people
will stash their wealth hoard up huge amounts of wealth
and they're not using it to actually do good for
society and there's a lot of various kind of tax
loopholes that they get away with because we're taxing income
is not actual wealth that's accumulated so any wealth over
let's say ten million dollars in cash or a hundred
million dollars in cash this wealth needs to be taxed
every single year maybe one percent maybe two percent five
percent I don't know you know the percentages aren't important
we can figure that out we could come to some
kind of compromises but this kind of extreme wealth definitely
needs to be taxed and especially extreme wealth of giant
corporations giant corporations like Apple Apple Google Amazon Facebook you
know they're they're building up cash reserves of 50 billion
dollars a hundred billion dollars this is this is absurd
they don't even know what to do with this money
and then of course they use it to and to
corrupt and to make various kinds of schemes and buyouts
and monopolies wishes all contributing to the problems we have
we need much higher estate taxes the idea that you
should be able to supply your children and offspring with
tens of millions of dollars of inheritance this is actually
doing a disservice to them because these people grow up
after this inheritance these trust fund babies and so forth
they don't have an appreciation of what it's like to
actually earn a living or to actually have to work
hard for for luxury or to work hard for freedom
they don't understand they can't empathize with people who have
two jobs or are working minimum wage and then of
course those people grow up and then they further corrupt
the system because they have these ideas that that you
know all those people they can just pull themselves up
by their bootstraps or just not working hard enough no
it's not that people aren't working hard enough it's that
the system is is highly rigged by the very wealthy
people who benefit the most from the system and that's
perpetuated with these low estate taxes that we have we
also need much higher corporate taxes corporations are making a
killing especially giant multi-billion corporations I think we should have
multiple tiers of taxes because we certainly don't want to
disincentivize small business a lot of times people make this
improper conflation would say all the open hole high corporate
taxes that will ruin the economy and and slow down
the economy and growth and all of this no it
won't because we're not gonna of course have high corporate
taxes on small businesses so if you're running a doughnut
shop and you have five or ten employees don't worry
you're not gonna have high corporate taxes under what I'm
proposing what I'm talking about is high corporate taxes for
giant companies that employ tens of thousands of people and
who rake in tens of billions of dollars of profit
every single year right so this is not small businesses
is not even medium business this is not even large
business this is gigantic t Nacional billion business right that's
what we're talking about here so they need to have
much higher corporate taxes that's pretty self-explanatory on the other
hand for people who are just starting businesses just starting
corporations that are only five employees ten employees under 100
employees these people need need tax breaks we need more
competition the way you incentivize competition is not by making
the tax environment favorable to these giant corporations but the
opposite making the tax environment favorable for small business so
I'm very very Pro small business and pro entrepreneurial I
think we need more of that and in fact the
biggest problem I have with giant corporations is that they
squeeze out the small businesses making it very difficult to
start your own entrepreneurial venture meaning that then people have
to become wage slaves because they have no other option
they can't start their own thing because Amazon or Walmart
or Starbucks is squeezing them out and then of course
with their corporate lobbying power and all the politicians that
they buy and the influence and the way they skew
the system towards themselves it becomes very difficult for individuals
to compete and to start new businesses and this is
bad because then we don't have competition we don't have
innovation we don't have creativity and then people aren't able
to to steer their own lives to be their own
CEOs they have to work as a lackey for some
giant corporate CEO and this is problematic because we do
want to develop autonomy within people we also need higher
capital gains tax and passive income tax right now the
whole system is is rigged in such a way that
hard manual labor is taxed the most yet manipulation of
economy through stocks arbitrage derivatives trading there's kinds of mortgage
schemes and all of this various kinds of massive income
where you don't work at all and yet you earn
millions of dollars and you hardly pay any tax on
it this is completely backwards we need ordinary working people
who work hard doing manual labor and and so forth
they should have the biggest tax breaks their income and
theirs their wages should be taxed at least whereas people
who just sit around and collect passive income from owning
real estate or from rentals these people need to be
taxed a lot more because they're not actually providing much
value to the system that are actually leeching off the
system because in a society really it's the people who
are doing actually all the all the labor and work
and of course labour isn't just physical labour but it's
also creative labor they are the ones who are really
driving society and getting the stuff done and those people
who are just sitting in and getting a bunch of
money from rental properties they're not doing very much they're
leeching off the system and this is not recognized right
now in our hyper capitalist society we also need to
eliminate a bunch of tax loopholes and safe havens you
should not be able to move a bunch of money
overseas to Ireland the way that Apple has been doing
billions of dollars fifty or hundred billion dollars sitting in
Irish banks to avoid taxation or to the Caribbean to
the Bahamas and and all these sorts of shenanigans this
all needs to be closed if you want to be
an American company and do business in America you need
to store the bulk of your funds in American banks
and it's gonna be regulated by American by American bureaucracy
by the government and all your wealth is going to
be tracked and then some percentage of it is gonna
be taxed if it's excessive and you're gonna pay taxes
on it and there's not gonna be all sorts of
corporate loopholes this will also simplify the tax code for
ordinary people which is what we need we also should
be putting high taxes on luxury goods why are we
not taxing private jets and yachts and golf courses and
Bentley's and luxury cars Ferraris sports cars the sorts of
stuff gieux expensive handbags this is all this needs to
be taxed an extra 20 percent or 50 percent I
don't know what it is if you want to have
these luxury frivolous items by all means have them but
you'll pay extra for it because there are more important
things for for Humanity than to satisfy your egotistical needs
for luxury in a high consciousness society these luxury goods
wouldn't even exist because it would be seen that they
offer no no genuine value no private jet offers some
value but you know Rolex and things like this this
is all quite silly we also need higher taxes on
secondary and tertiary homes people who buy their first home
to raise a family in to actually live in these
people should pay very little in real estate taxes and
so forth on the other hand people who just speculate
on real estate or people who buy a third house
of a fourth house a fifth house all around the
country you know they have these elaborate mansions that they
barely spent any time in vacation homes multiple vacation homes
you know in in Aspen Colorado or in Hawaii this
or this is all frivolous luxury stuff so if you
want that go ahead but you're gonna pay extra for
it and also we have a problem that major cities
like New York San Francisco and areas in California the
LA area real estate prices are soaring to the point
where people are not even able to afford their first
house ordinary people don't have a house to grow a
family in and that's because there's a lot of foreign
investment a lot of real estate speculation so that needs
to be significantly taxed you should pay significant taxes on
real estate if you don't actually live in that real
estate yourself but you're just squatting on it to resell
it later and there needs to be some disincentives for
flipping and just reselling real estate because this is um
this doesn't offer any serious value to the society and
yet people make a lot of money off of it
which means that ultimately they're they're exploiting others that are
lower down the chain another interesting idea that I've heard
is to allow tax payers to choose where some proportion
of their tax dollars actually go now this won't happen
in detail but the way that I picture it is
that when you submit your taxes every year on April
15th the IRS gives you a pop-up window you know
on the website and you get to select from maybe
ten different categories where you want maybe ten or twenty
percent of your tax dollars to go so you can
either select a category like improve health care improve green
energy improve schools improve you know give it to NASA
improve space exploration give it towards scientific research and development
to universities give it towards helping the homeless giving it
give it towards helping children you know foster children give
it towards helping animals with you know animal shelters and
for dogs and cats and all that so you know
we'll have like 10 or 20 different categories and you
get to select where 10 or 20 percent of your
tax dollars goes one of the things I love about
this idea is that we need more we need more
people to be excited and interested about like being involved
in government so that it's not just some sort of
like thing that exists politicians interact with it but then
I as an ordinary citizen don't have any say like
what actually happens and also at the same time what
we need to be more accountability so we need government
to be sending us reports so at the end of
the year after you've selected you know where your money's
gonna go let's say you said that your money's gonna
go to NASA ok maybe you're into space exploration you
like that cool but then at the end of the
year NASA sends you a letter that says okay here's
what we actually we took all your money for this
year from all you guys here's the stuff that we've
actually used the money for we're going to plan a
mission to Mars we're gonna plan a mission to the
moon here's how it's gonna happen here's you know where
we did well here's where we did poorly here how
we're gonna like cut costs in the future here's why
you should pay us more next year right you see
now they're incentivized to actually use your money well because
they know that if they don't use your money well
there's gonna be a graph that tracks like how much
waste there is in their budget and what kind of
missions they were able to succeed in which kind they
weren't then the next year you won't pay them and
so they have to kind of compete for your money
that would be a cool I think idea next we
need much stronger penalties for corruption and white-collar crime a
lot of drama is made about sort of blue collar
crime you know the common criminals thugs and gang members
and so forth this is not the biggest problem gang
members don't actually pose a significant systemic problem to society
of course you know a gang member might might shoot
somebody that's a problem we do need to stop them
of course so that's important but we're law and order
really needs to shine is with white-collar crime because white-collar
crime it's the senior officers and managers of these giant
corporations which create all sorts of schemes and scams and
very manipulative systems which lead to the corruption of the
entire government and actually rob people of a lot of
money exploit a lot of people or actually even lead
to the deaths of many people so for example you
know some some CEO of big pharma company wants to
to push opioids you know to push up his stock
price and so he creates various kinds of sneaky advertising
campaigns and bribes and pays doctors to prescribe these opioids
by giving them airs kinds of kickbacks and so forth
and incentives you know this kind of scheme will actually
lead to the death of not a handful of people
that gets shot up in some urban neighborhood this leads
to the death of thousands of people across the whole
country right so there need to be proportional penalties for
this kind of stuff there needs to be an entire
department within the government that that regulates this and chases
after it like seriously and there need to be serious
criminal liabilities for CEOs and senior managers and officers of
corporations so that they are very careful about what they
market how they advertise what kind of schemes they come
up with because they can come up with some pretty
uh exploitative schemes and a lot of times right now
they just get fined there are no criminal liabilities the
problem with the fines that the fines are less than
the profit they make so for them it's just a
simple cost-benefit analysis and for them it's like well yeah
I'll get fined a hundred million dollars for pushing these
opioids but hey I'll earn three hundred million dollars so
you know three hundred million dollars - one hundred million
dollars fine I still come out ahead with two hundred
million dollars so of course I'm gonna do it that
isn't enough of a penalty there need to be criminal
penalties if you do that kind of [ __ ]
you go to jail for twenty years as the CEO
you know there needs to be a lot more accountability
and ethics placed upon CEOs and senior officers managers of
these giant corporations then there is right now because right
now they can get away with some really exploitative and
nasty stuff which tricks a lot of people you know
a lot of ordinary people they're easy to trick because
it's hard for them to compete with modern marketing modern
marketing you know it's a scientific it's it's it's really
scientific psychological warfare it has been for the last hundred
years psychology is used and emotionality is used to manipulate
people into buying all sorts of things and everyone in
marketing and in advertising all the CEOs and managers they
all know this but they're all in denial about it
and they all act as though it's just totally normal
and ethical and they just act that this this does
not corrupt or worse in society but of course it
does it directly contributes to many of our problems if
you want more on that this is such a profound
topic I'm really passionate about the corruption of of marketing
check out my episode called the deep problem of marketing
search for that and it'll go into more depth about
that problem another powerful idea that I got from Neil
Walsh is the following proposal we need to publicly disclose
everyone's income in the entire country and all profit margins
on all products sold Surratt a radical idea but think
about the beauty of this because what it does introduces
transparency and it helps to promote equality so imagine if
there was a government database you go to this database
you can type in the name of any citizen or
any corporation or any product and immediately what you see
is you see the person's income a histogram of that
person's income or that corporations income and their profit margins
imagine if you could see the income and salaries of
your co-workers your boss your CEO and so forth this
would be amazing because immediately you would be able to
see the unfairness the injustice of the entire system so
of course the reason there isn't this transparency the reason
corporations are very much against disclosing the salaries of all
employees publicly is precisely because they know the system is
so rigged that if it was may transparent people would
be so outraged by the injustice of it that the
system couldn't stand so of course they keep it all
hidden in the darkness and in the shadows is where
the injustice can lurk people don't even know how much
they're being screwed because you don't even know how much
your coworker is making more than you you know imagine
if in your little company where maybe there's 20 people
that you work with you work with a team of
20 people but you don't know what their salaries are
maybe you know for a few people but not for
all of them but imagine if you could just go
to this database and just check and you would immediately
see like wait a minute why is Joe orderly twice
as much as me even though he does half the
work that I do you see or why is that
man earning twice as much as the women in the
office this would help with that now don't get me
wrong I'm not saying that everyone's income should be equal
certainly not some people work harder and they should have
higher incomes if Joe is doing twice the work that
I am that everybody else is in the office and
he's earning twice as much income that's fair people will
look at that and they'll say well yeah you know
George Joe deserves it cuz he worked so much harder
than everybody else but a lot of times Joe isn't
earning that extra money because he works harder Joe is
earning extra money because he was you know he got
a favor from the boss or he has some sort
of good negotiating skills or because he's white or because
he's well-connected or because he's a man or whatever that
is you see so so this will help a lot
with that I also think we need labels on all
products that are sold so imagine going to best buyer
to Walmart and you're looking at a at an iPhone
on the Shelf there or you're looking at some video
game you want to buy there should be a sticker
that says what the profit margin on that product is
so you can see which industries are screwing you over
you know when I get a medical bill from the
hospital or from the doctor I want to see what
the doctors profit margins are if I get a bill
from the lawyer I want to see what his profit
margins are this would help to equalize a system because
when you get that bill from from the hospital and
you see that they charge you some ridiculous amount where
their profit margin is ten thousand percent on some medicine
that they gave you or some you know simple procedure
some x-ray that they gave you but that x-ray has
a ten thousand percent profit margin that's going to create
the outrage that's necessary to equalize the system right now
these systems are deliberately designed to be so opaque and
so convoluted that nobody is able to make sense of
these profit margins and then when you tell some giant
pharmaceutical company that hey you're you're overcharging us they will
deny it and they will say oh no we're not
overcharging you this is just business you know we need
to survive too but if we know your profit margins
we know how much you're raking in we know the
salary of everybody who works there we know exactly how
much you're overcharging and then we can compare you know
how much is the pharmaceutical industry overcharging compared to the
school or an education industry and you'll see there's gonna
be a huge disparity and then that will help to
equalize the whole system and speaking of transparency we need
transparency all throughout government we need to do a giant
pass through all the departments to make them all more
transparent every single year there should be reports of how
government is becoming more and more transparent everything needs to
be taken out of the shadows because in the shadows
is where the evil and the corruption and selfishness reside
if you're doing something truly conscious and loving you don't
need to hide it in the shadows and speaking of
which we need a strong defence of whistleblowers right now
the way that America treats whistleblowers is completely ass-backwards we
demonize them we prosecute them criminalize them chase them out
of the country the stuff that happened with Chelsea Manning
with Edward Snowden in recent years the WikiLeaks we quick
Skye Julian Assange all these sorts of things you know
these are whistleblowers who are actually helping to expose government
corruption they should have legal protections the government should be
welcoming of whistleblowers whistleblowers should receive financial compensation for the
risks that they take they should receive protection for their
families for their safety and security against threats they should
get medals they should be publicized and lionize as heroes
for calling out corruption not demonized it's really quite disgusting
what we have right now a high consciousness government is
all about transparency it wants and it welcomes transparency because
it doesn't have anything to hide from the people we
also need more transparency with the way that government contracts
are awarded this is a very corrupt element of the
government these extremely lucrative billion dollar contracts are oftentimes given
in secret to various kinds of giant corporations we have
which have power and connection there's no open and fair
bidding process really we need like a public marketplace where
every time there's a a new government contract that comes
out any corporation no matter how big how small can
can vote on it can bid on it and then
that whole process needs to be made transparent and we
need to know how well these corporations follow through on
these contracts because a lot of times what happens is
these corporations grossly overcharge the government for for simple things
that they offer they charge ten times as much as
they will charge if they were selling to consumers because
they know that the government doesn't care and that the
government is bought by them so it's all very corrupt
so we need to introduce competition into the contract process
we also need to remove all black ops programs and
budgets if the CIA has black ops budgets we remove
that any kind of secret spying programs secret assassination programs
secret programs to destabilize other governments this this this this
should not exist this is devilry it's pure devilry this
kind of stuff shouldn't exist we shouldn't have secret budgets
for exporting people out of the country to torture them
these sorts of budgets are secret and black ops precisely
because the people know the people running these programs know
that if the public found out about it they would
be so outraged that they would cancel the program and
if you say well Lea but we need these black
ops programs because we're so vulnerable to external attack my
answer to you is stop thinking out of fear that's
a fear-based decision we don't need to be so fearful
especially as Americans I mean if if we were a
smaller country like France maybe you might have an argument
but as America our military is ten times bigger and
more advanced than any other military on earth so we
don't need these black ops programs torture programs none of
this is necessary this is all fear-based we need to
be confident enough in in ourselves that we trust that
we set a better example for the world through consciousness
and through love and through selflessness and giving up a
little bit of our security give it up it's not
you don't need it you're not that vulnerable don't be
so fragile see don't be acting out of fear being
act don't be acting out of scarcity be acting out
of abundance and love of course speaking of the military
we need to drastically reduce the American military budget it's
completely out of hand is completely corrupt we need to
scale back our military especially abroad we have bases hundreds
of bases all around the world that are very expensive
to maintain we need to cut back on that we
also need to stop selling weapons and bombs overseas because
the way the milind military-industrial complex works right now is
that if we're not waging some unnecessary war and burning
a bunch of money that way to pay these defense
contractors then the way that they do it in peacetime
like right now is they they sell a bunch of
weapons and bombs and jet fighters and tanks to all
sorts of countries all around the world many of these
countries are shady we sell weapons to Saudi Arabia to
Turkey to god-knows-where and this is completely backwards completely unconscious
because think about what percentage of American psychic creative energy
and resources is going towards building weapons and bombs and
shipping those overseas for profit this is absurd that creative
energy these resources need to be going towards building infrastructure
internally in the country towards better education schools universities towards
better science better space exploration help better health care health
for people who need it homeless people so forth that's
where that creative energy needs to be going we're literally
squandering half of the creative energy of the entire country
by having people building weapons and by manipulating markets and
doing other kinds of things that don't provide genuine value
to the world you know a weapon if you think
about it provides very little value to the world like
a bomb of course it does provide some value if
you're getting attacked but overall many of these bombs they're
built and they're not even used and then they have
a short shelf life you can't just keep a bomb
for 50 years the thing becomes dangerous it has to
be decommissioned so not only do we waste money building
the bomb in the first place these are expensive million-dollar
bombs then we spend more millions of dollars to to
decommission these bombs or to rebuild these bombs and so
the whole thing is extremely wasteful if you think about
it it's not actually generating more wealth for the country
only for a top select few who are the defense
contractors or so forth we also need to work towards
denuclearization this is a long-term project obviously it's not going
to happen in a year or two but over the
long term we need to move towards total denuclearization of
all governments around the world and of course this can
only be done through high-level negotiations and various kinds of
UN diplomacy and so forth we also need to increase
funding to police and first responders so while we'll be
cutting back on the military budget and by the way
I should say we're not cutting back on the money
for troops that's not what I mean by cutting the
military budget we cut back on ridiculous excessive wasteful technologies
that are totally unnecessary and overpowered like new nuclear weapons
and new jet fighters like this sort of stuff we
cut back on that but the troops will actually need
to get a pay increase because right now they're not
earning nearly enough and then also by cutting the military
budget we use that money to improve police training and
resources for first responders they need better resources and better
training and the police need much better training on racial
sensitivity much better training on negotiating de-escalating situations rather than
just using physical force we also just need more police
we also need more FBI agents to enforce various kinds
of laws and to stop criminals gangs and mafia and
white-collar criminals and scammers and fraudsters and all of this
right this this is all improved by having more FBI
more prosecutors state prosecutors federal prosecutors and better training for
all of them and higher salaries for all of them
so that they're less corruptible and that they're they're more
comfortable in their work we also need strong war crimes
enforcement right now the government does a pretty bad job
when we're engaged in some military conflict a lot of
times there's war crimes and these war crimes are actually
hidden and denied rather than made transparent and properly prosecuted
the way they should be and actually this is a
service towards military members because military people didn't join the
military to be war criminals so when war crimes are
allowed to be tolerated and actually hidden then this actually
does a disservice because it tarnishes the image of the
military we also need to of course eliminate torture and
cruel and unusual punishment not only do we to eliminate
it on American shores but we need to eliminate it
entirely there should be some sort of law or even
a constitutional amendment which says that not only can you
not torture and do cruel and unusual punishment like waterboarding
and so forth on the u.s. territory land but you're
not allowed to export this torture and punishment to other
countries this sort of process that became popular under the
Bush era of called extraordinary rendition where you would take
some sort of suspected criminal or terrorist and then you
would export him to Turkey where he would get tortured
or to Guantanamo Bay or something like this this is
absurd it should be illegal to torture anyone as an
American citizen if you're involved with torturing anyone anywhere in
the world you should be criminally liable for that and
any kind of funding that even goes into any of
that kind of extraordinary we also need some sort of
legislation that helps workers get elected to corporate boards this
is something that I think is Europe is leading the
way on right now it's really one of the core
tenets of socialism is the idea that workers have a
say and how their company is run and while I'm
not advocating full-blown socialism here I think one of the
elements of socialism that we need to adopt more of
is right now the workers in a giant corporation like
Walmart or Amazon or Microsoft or Google or Apple or
Facebook these workers have almost no voting power they have
no say over how their corporation is run therefore the
corporation is you know the corporate leaders who have all
the shares and stocks they are able to dictate all
all the corporation's decisions and therefore if the corporation decides
to ship half the jobs overseas even though that's terrible
for workers the workers have no say and the jobs
get shipped overseas whereas if the workers did have a
say if they had a 50% control of the corporate
board if the corporate board was 50% made up of
workers that are at the bottom of the hierarchy then
that would completely change how many of these corporations are
run so I think we need some sort of law
which says that if you have a corporation that profits
over a billion dollars a year and employs over 5,000
or 10,000 people then you must have at least 50%
of your corporate board run by by your workers and
for smaller businesses these regulations will be less strict and
if your business only has five or ten people then
you won't be subject to this maybe at all yeah
so we figure out the details of it but that's
the general idea this will make working for corporations a
lot better we also need to defend we need a
strong defense of the right to unionize so if people
want to unionize they should be allowed to unionize in
any corporation that interferes with unionization efforts that should be
illegal and actually it should be criminal and a lot
of corporations play these tactics where they strong-arm their employees
or they threaten their employees not to unionize I know
Amazon does this Whole Foods does this a bunch of
corporate based probably all corporations do this of course they
try to keep it all under the table where as
soon as somebody tries to unionize they get fired or
they get threatened or whatever they get demonized this should
be illegal we need to raise the minimum wage to
be a living wage at least fifty dollars an hour
maybe twenty dollars an hour now of course libertarians here
will complain they'll say Oh leo but if you do
this you'll actually you'll hurt the economy because many many
jobs will no longer be tenable because some jobs simply
can't exist at those wages this is a silly argument
it's a silly argument if a job can't exist at
fifteen to twenty dollars an hour then that job shouldn't
exist and also studies have shown when certain states raise
their minimum wage for example the minimum wage in in
Washington or in California is significantly higher than it is
in other parts of the country this does not have
a negative impact on the economy so this idea that
raising a minute wage has a negative impact on this
is a canard this is this is not true and
if you think about it like think about it very
fundamentally there's actually no reason it's very artificial that someone
who works as a housekeeper or flips burgers at McDonald's
should earn less than a doctor or a lawyer or
a politician or a CEO it's extremely artificial that the
system is set up this way now I'm not saying
that everyone should eat you know generate the same wage
because people do provide different value and I understand that
a CEO provides a lot more value than someone flipping
burgers at McDonald's so in a sense that's true but
also a sense it's not true and the idea that
the CEO can earn a thousand times more than the
minimum wage of his workers is is absurd and also
this this idea that oh well leo minimum wage is
only for people like students not full you know nobody
lives on a minimum wage I'm in a way just
like four kids in high school this is not true
at all many people who are in their 40s 50s
and 60s work on a minimum wage the problem with
minimum wage is that the corporations are so powerful that
they they're they can strong arm you with monopolies and
other kinds of tactics that they use so that you're
not able to negotiate your wage properly you see that's
that's what many libertarians don't understand about this whole free
market idea yes the free market is nice in principle
in theory but the problems that the corporation has amassed
so much power that it's impossible for one individual employee
to seriously challenge that corporation which is why unionization is
important because it helps to equalize that balance of power
and likewise you know if you're working a minimum-wage job
at Starbucks or something and you go in to ask
your boss for a raise they have very sneaky psychological
mechanisms and systems designed to deny you that raise that's
the reality of how this works it's not like you
can just go in there just ask them for a
raise and just like negotiate with them no because you
have virtually zero leverage and they know that you're basically
barely able to pay your bills so you can't afford
losing that job so the reason government is necessary to
raise the minimum wage is because government serves as a
proxy negotiator for ordinary small people who otherwise don't have
the power to individually negotiate with these giant multi-billion dollar
corporations that use various exploitative tactics to make sure that
wages are maximally low and this is highly grossly unethical
and unconscious but it's so normalized that people seriously argue
that raising their wage to $15 is gonna somehow damage
society or damage the economy this is absurd it's absurd
you have no appreciation of what it's like to work
in the minimum wage like it's it's read some read
some accounts of people who actually work minimum wage jobs
some adults there are books that have been written about
this stuff one good one that comes to mind is
called nickel and dimed I think by Barbara Ehrenreich nickel
and dimed she was a reporter I read this book
in a long time ago in university basically she was
an investigative reporter and what she did is she she
posed as a minimum wage worker for like a month
or two she kind of made this challenge herself she
wanted to know what it's like to be a minimum
wage worker so what she did is she she gave
up all her possessions and all her money for like
a month or two and then she went and tried
to just survive by working a minimum-wage job and it
was so difficult for her and she was a well-educated
you know a journalist and so forth but you know
she had to not rely on any of her skills
there she had to just like go clean homes or
work minimum wage she was a housekeeper and so forth
and like it was so difficult for her to survive
it was like hell that's the reality of being stuck
in minimum wage you're so stuck in it that you
can't even break free of it because you don't have
enough money to pay for the next week's rent and
next week's groceries it's quite quite brutal and various kinds
of highfalutin ideas that that that wealthy people have about
how how a minimum wage is not such a big
problem it's a huge problem it's a huge problem that
right now than in a way it was like $7.25
federally that's a huge problem it's not a living wage
you can't survive on this and the reality is that
many people try to survive and live on a minimum
wage and they can't it's not just kids and teenagers
we also need very importantly regulation of predatory industries and
here are the particular industries that need the most regulation
banking marketing finance stocks and Wall Street loans the military-industrial
complex Big Oil chemical companies big technology companies like Apple
Facebook Microsoft Amazon Google big pharmaceutical companies communication companies like
Comcast Cox charter Verizon AT&T t-mobile and so forth Healthcare
entire healthcare industry he's a lot more regulation the insurance
industry which includes car insurance life insurance annuities and all
sorts of other scammy insurance schemes and credit card companies
and also payday loans all of this needs massive regulation
so again what the libertarians and the free-market folks don't
understand is that these industries are so manipulative in how
they're designed to leech money from consumers that consumers have
no choice and no chance to outsmart these various companies
hidden fees sneaky high pressure sales tactics various kinds of
you know chemical pollution price gouging within the pharmaceutical industry
all the various kinds of corruption Anakin's that goes on
on Wall Street that led to the collapse in 2008
with the with the various kinds of sneaky mortgages and
subprime mortgages all this kind of crap that they invent
the stuff that goes on with the military-industrial complex there's
government contracts they get these communication companies which create monopolies
in various parts of the country the healthcare system which
is basically a health care cartel or mafia this is
extremely corrupt it they're extremely powerful and no individual citizen
is able to put up a serious fight so the
reason we need government regulation is because again government is
serving as the proxy negotiator for the people who otherwise
are way too underpowered to deal with this stuff we
need regulation of usury and lending the various kinds of
hidden variable interest rates on credit cards that goes on
various kinds of hidden banking fees that banks charge you
like oh this is disgusting it doesn't provide any serious
value to society all of this is designed to leach
value from society you see this not only that but
all these industries that I've mentioned notice the following thing
these industries which leech the most value and provide the
least value to society they are the ones that earn
the most money so what are the most wealthiest paid
professions it's doctors insurance salesmen CEOs Wall Street bankers it's
it's pharmaceutical marketing it's giant oil corporations it's military contractors
its military lobbyists its chemical companies its various kinds of
payday loan operators these people make the most money yet
they provide the least value for society this is completely
backwards and this is devilry and of course it's these
people which keep rigging the system to maintain the status
quo because it's in their favor because they don't want
to actually do legitimate creative work they want to exploit
the work of others and this is not something that
you can fix by removing regulation and getting rid of
government because if you get rid of government the way
libertarians want this will only get worse it'll get a
lot worse you don't even know how bad it'll get
it's already quite bad but it'll get terrible if what
the libertarians want was actually implemented and government was significantly
scaled back this is my biggest criticism of the conservative
agenda Republicans and conservatives are all about small government but
the problem is that when you make government as small
as you guys want what you're not understanding is that
you will be completely enslaved and exploited by these giant
corporate companies because there's gonna be a complete dis balance
of power you see who's gonna control these companies the
free market is not going to control these companies because
the free market allows these companies the freedom to manipulate
and exploit you that's what the free market is so
the government is necessary to regulate the free market that's
what the libertarian doesn't understand we also need a very
strong antitrust regulation and he trusts right now is not
being enforced giant companies every every month I read giant
companies buying up smaller companies or two giant companies merging
with each other lately the FCC I think approved the
merger of Sprint and t-mobile this is all anti-competitive it
hurts the free market these giant companies are buying up
little companies again it's it's removing the incentive for the
little companies to actually create high quality products because all
they basically do is that the small company just tries
to be successful and popular enough so the larger company
won't even buy it the large company buys it because
it's got billions of dollars that it doesn't know what
to do with anymore and it'll buy a lot of
these small companies even if the small companies aren't really
good or they don't have a good product they'll still
just buy them just to buy out competition this is
extremely corrupt and it's ruining our entire system basically what's
your company gets to a certain size you should not
be able to buy other companies that's sort of my
simple rule for this so you know if your company
is earning over a million dollars of profit a quarter
that's it that's as big as you get to get
by buying other companies after that point if you want
to keep growing your company by all means go ahead
but you can't buy anymore companies not big ones not
small ones not little ones and you can't merge with
anybody else that would be the sort of rule that
I would put into place and that's like a strict
rule that just is automatically enforced so that these companies
don't even get the idea to go merging with larger
companies or buying up smaller companies and then that will
create more competition in the marketplace have the large companies
actually compete with the upstarts that are coming up rather
than buy them out let's have Facebook actually compete with
Instagram and with whatsapp and all this sorts of stuff
rather than just buying them out and then just like
adding them to their portfolio it's way too easy when
you have tens of billions of dollars in your coffers
of cash that you have no idea what to do
with you couldn't spend it all if you wanted to
like for example for Apple or for Google they have
this much cash in their coffers it's way too easy
for them to just use that money to buy up
every possible competitor in their industry and in this way
they dominate and monopolize the whole industry hurting innovation creativity
and competition we need special regulations for companies that are
over a billion dollars because these companies have the potential
to exploit millions of people in various ways and it's
very difficult for ordinary people to be aware of what
these companies are doing because these companies are spending billions
of dollars on research and development and focus groups and
psychological tests to craft their products and services in such
a way that it's it's so sneaky that an ordinary
person has has no way of combating this they just
get exploited that's sort of what society has become right
now most consumers are like cattle that are being and
farmed by these giant corporations and they don't even know
it and they don't have the power to do anything
about it other than through the government we also need
a stable currency which legally cannot be fudged or screwed
around with by printing a bunch more money so we
need much tighter regulations on banking and the Federal Reserve
and just you're not you're not supposed to be able
to just willy-nilly print currency in a in a conscious
society there need to be some limits on that we
also need shorter limits on copyrights right now giant corporations
again are leeching off of past creative work for hundreds
of years because the copyrights keep getting extended longer and
longer and longer you know like Disney keeps milking Mickey
Mouse even though Mickey Mouse is probably a hundred years
old by this point and they still keep milking it
and they Lobby the government to extend their mickey mouse
copyright for another hundred years this is completely absurd copyrights
should not last longer than the death of the inventor
of the copyright so if Walt Disney invented Mickey Mouse
he can have Mickey Mouse until he dies but after
he's dead he can't have Mickey Mouse anymore and then
Disney is now forced to be more creative and actually
to come up with a new cartoon rather than just
keep milk in the same [ __ ] for a
hundred years or 200 years the way that they want
to do see we need an end of for-profit prisons
it's way too corrupt the incentive structure is completely wrong
prison also needs to be radically rethought prison should not
be treated primarily as a punishment prison needs to be
thought of more as a rehabilitation center the way that
prison is treated in the Scandinavian countries in Northern Europe
that's how America needs to start to model its prisons
as rehabilitation centers there needs to be more compassion and
empathy placed into the way that we treat prisoners they're
not evil people no matter who they killed or you
know what kind of crimes they've committed they're just ignorant
people and what they need is they need education they
need spirituality they need meditation and one of the biggest
things we can do to help them is to introduce
non-dogmatic spirituality into prison it's not Christian it's not Muslim
it's not dogmatic it's not a religion it's mindfulness training
meditation training various yoga programs this sorts of stuff if
we introduce this into prison this will enormous ly helped
to improve recidivism rates it'll reduce crime it'll help these
people get back on their feet me to have jobs
programs where if this person comes out of prison he
can go there he can get a job he doesn't
have to go back out on the streets and do
drugs or sell crack or whatever you know just to
make ends meet so we need to treat our prisoners
with a lot more compassion and the only way that's
possible is through an expansion of one's own sense of
identity and consciousness collective and individual consciousness because right now
what people do is they demonize criminals they blame all
the problems on the criminals and they think of criminals
as the other because you know hey I'm not a
criminal and I would never be as bad as a
criminal or some murderers and rapists and so therefore those
people are just garbage and scum and we can just
treat them that way well that ends up coming back
to bite you because you know when that drug dealer
or criminal or rapist when he gets released the recidivism
rate is like 70 percent so he doesn't help you
to demonize the guy because you know the average criminal
is only gonna be in jail for five or ten
years he's not gonna be in jail if the rest
his life so when he comes back out what have
you done to actually help his situation because if you
haven't helped him he's gonna become a problem within your
society see not to mention that it's just it's the
humane thing to do to try to rehabilitate people now
I'm not saying everybody can read it you can be
rehabilitated some people are totally lost causes but we should
at least try and our Sister's should be structured in
such a way that it's it helps the majority I
think the majority of these criminals can be helped minority
can't be and you know that we just deal with
those but um but I think a majority can be
well I'm gonna talk about ending the drug war but
while we're on prisons we also need to release all
people who are in prison for minor drug possession charges
but that's part of my schpeel hunting to ending the
drug war we'll get to that we also need to
be more caring about refugees and immigrants understanding that the
countries are coming from are terrible and very problematic and
we need to be welcoming to refugees and to immigrants
within what we can tolerate the thing that many conservatives
as they argue against refugees and immigrants and illegals the
thing that conservatives understand is that we have a gigantic
[ __ ] country in America yeah we have 330
million people we can take a lot of immigrants and
refugees we can support a lot more have you ever
flown across the country across America on an airplane and
you look out of the [ __ ] window and
you see just empty land stretching out for miles and
miles across the horizon just empty land nobody's using it
so get rid of this scarcity mindset and somehow we're
limited we can only support so many people dude we
can support hundred literally hundreds of millions more people in
America so get rid of that scarcity mindset that fear-based
mindset be more abundant abundance minded next time you're flying
across the country look out that [ __ ] window
of your airplane and notice how much empty land and
how many resources trees lakes rivers oceans we have so
many resources there so we don't need to worry about
running out of physical land or physical resources we have
way more resis resources on this planet than people think
if we just use and manage the resources properly the
problem is not that we're running out of resources the
problem is that we're completely mismanaging the resources because our
love our lack of ecological and strategic planning so as
we become more strategic in ecological and more efficient we
will be able to support billions literally billions of more
people on this planet I think this planet could support
a hundred billion humans if not more with advancements in
technology and proper recycling of resources and proper management of
resources so I don't buy to this idea at all
that all we have seven billion people and it's so
overpopulated is so terrible and we just we have to
like we have to all be afraid of not having
enough water and not having enough air and not having
enough trees and not having enough animals this is this
is [ __ ] that's scarcity mentality we just need
to manage this stuff a lot better we also need
to work towards eliminating poverty hunger and homelessness we can
have programs that can mmm that can end this stuff
it's really not hard to end the stuff we just
lack the will and the compassion love and consciousness to
do it we could certainly do it if we had
the political will to do it if the people demanded
that it be done speaking of the environment we need
heavy environmental regulation not just because of global warming although
that's a huge issue which is scientifically um indubitable at
this point but also even if global warming wasn't an
issue we still have issue issues with pollution with toxic
water heavy metals in in food which cause all sorts
of diseases and autoimmune conditions and our reliance on on
dirty sources of energy mmm like fossil fuels helps to
contribute to problems in the Middle East so all of
this is interrelated so we need heavy regulation of this
stuff heavy regulation of emissions we need much more renewable
energy we need a massive funding of green energy we
need a carbon tax on polluters we need to stop
using coal entirely and other kinds of dirty fuel sources
like maybe burning of gas and so forth we need
to replace this with with solar primarily maybe with wind
as well we need massive subsidies for solar massive subsidies
for electric vehicles we need National Grid of electric charging
stations at every gas station across the entire country and
maybe even incentivize people who use them by making that
electricity totally free so if you buy an electric car
you get to charge up for free that would be
a nice incentive we also of course need nice incentives
for buying electric vehicles and we need government research programs
to fund better battery technologies for electric vehicles because one
of the things that's holding back the mass adoption of
electric vehicles right now is insufficient battery technology insufficient capacity
to produce these batteries insufficient battery life the batteries are
too expensive so all these costs need to be massively
brought down with with government funding really what we need
is we need sort of like we had the the
moon landing program in the 60s with Kennedy like a
ten year program to get a man to the moon
we a ten year program like that which invests billions
of dollars into researching green energy and battery technology that
will be huge and revolutionary and will pay enormous dividends
for a century to come I also want to see
toxic testing of food water air at products and cosmetics
there should be a government department that all it does
is it does toxicity testing of all the products that
people consume so if you're consuming pills if you're consuming
food fast food potato chips Snickers bars soda if you're
drinking bottled water if you're like you should be able
to go on this website type in the brand type
in your city type in your location and immediately the
product should come up it should tell you when this
product was last tested how much mercury isn't that product
how much lead is in that product where this product
was sourced all the chemicals and all the plastic in
it all of it it should be able to tell
you what the air pollution standards are of your particular
town that you live in all this should be just
a free publicly accessible government database you know baby food
needs to be tested this agency just need to be
non-stop testing this stuff Cosmetics every cosmetic brand needs to
be tested for lead mercury and other sorts of nasty
chemicals that are in it this is ruining our society
in a very sneaky way because what happens at these
heavy metals which are present throughout food and cosmetics and
so forth shampoo soap that you use especially if it's
cheap stuff this gets into your body then it gets
into your brain then it actually ruins your in your
capacity to think it lowers IQs there's been studies done
on this you know lead in children lowers IQs and
increases criminal behavior increases schizophrenia and various kinds of psychopathologies
that that end up biting us in the ass collectively
so all this needs to be tested and not to
mention all of the diseases chronic fatigue zand fibromyalgia and
all sorts of autumn there's hundreds of different autoimmune conditions
that result because of these this heavy metal toxicity that
people don't even know about you see the reason we
need government to help with this stuff is because it's
partly a problem of Education ignorance that's mostly what the
problem is and also because you as an individual consumer
you know I can't possibly go test the mercury content
of every brand of soda that I might want to
drink or every bottle of water brand of bottled water
that I might want to drink or every cosmetic that
you know some some woman might want to use she
can't go and test all this stuff by herself people
can't go test every fish you know they can't test
a salmon and a tuna and a shark in this
and then find out like where these sharks and Salmons
and tunas come from and then how much mercury and
lead is in them or the baby food how do
you know you don't know that's the problem and because
you don't know the companies are not under any obligation
to provide you with clean water or food or products
or cosmetics because they know that you don't care and
if you don't care you don't know then that means
the only way that they can win you as a
customer is just by being the cheapest and by being
the cheapest oftentimes it's the polluted - next we need
massive funding for mental health we need free mental health
and schools at work - anybody who wants it free
mental health - even - criminals people in prisons there's
like mental health all across the board this will significantly
help with various kinds of school shootings mass shootings that
we have and many other problems besides shootings that we
have mental health is a huge thing I would invest
hundreds of billions of dollars into mental health this directly
increases the consciousness and quality of all of society for
everybody free therapy for everybody free life coaching for everybody
help people to figure out their own minds this is
the most important thing because your mind if it's not
functioning properly it's going to ruin your life but not
just your life your family's life your spouse's life your
children's life and then it's a trickle effect where you
know I have some kind of mental disorder or you
know neurosis I don't get treatment for it so I
offload it on to my children you know cuz i
abused my children now i get angry at my shoulder
and i criticize my children i harass my children of
course that it spreads and infects their minds and then
it affects their children's minds and so on and so
on and so on for generations see and then this
contributes to crime both violent crime but also white-collar crime
of various kinds it contributes to abusive relationships and a
lot of women get abused in relationships precisely because the
men don't get proper counseling therapy and treatment for their
anger and other issues so that that's very important we
need massive funding for organic farming we need much stricter
regulations for factory farming there's some really disgusting stuff that
goes on with factory farming and what's even more disgusting
is that they're actually laws in many states which prevent
the disclosure and transparency of the kind of nasty stuff
that happens within factory farming we need transparency within factory
farming you know in certain states I think in in
Texas there's a law that it's illegal to actually bring
a video camera into a factory farm into a slaughterhouse
and if why why would there be such a law
because the things that happen in a slaughterhouse are so
horrific and disgusting that if the public caught wind of
it the people who own that slaughterhouse know that their
business would end so we need to stop those laws
we need more transparency we need more regulation we govern
people go into these factories checking them for humane conditions
and overall we can be moving away from factory farming
towards organic sustainable free-range sort of farming we also need
massive funding for infrastructure roads bridges airports and various kinds
of public transportation massive funding for public transportation including monorails
tunnels electric buses high-speed trains like they have in Japan
and elsewhere connecting major cities improvement and remodel is a
ssin of airports electric scooters other sorts of clever new
transportation devices that are being invented all of this needs
to be to be massively funded by the government and
you know it's not necessarily that the government needs to
manufacture the scooters I'm not saying that I'm not saying
the government needs to manufacture monorail zand and trains the
government can just subsidize this stuff and can actually help
the private sector to do this stuff because you know
we don't really need the government per se to be
to be running monorails but by subsidizing it and incentivizing
it this will actually help smaller businesses rise up and
invent new kinds of technologies and you know transportation infrastructure
that helps society one of the most important elements of
society is the infrastructure the physical infrastructure the electric grid
the the internet grid the roads the highways the water
system the pipes the sewage system the filtration systems the
airport system you know in America all airports are actually
publicly run they're not private I think that's right I
think that's right the airline's themselves are are private but
the airports and the air traffic control I think that's
all government and so you know see it works so
again there's this talking point that libertarians and conservatives like
to throw out that that all léo witness government on
anything that actually works well how about the airport's how
about airport security how about NASA landing stuff on the
moon or to Mars how about the post office works
pretty well I've used the post office and it works
just as well as s FedEx or UPS no less
efficient effect the post office always gives me better prices
than UPS or FedEx does I was I just shipped
a package of the other day via Priority Mail and
it costs like a significant amount less it costs like
20 or 30 percent less than UPS or FedEx the
post office will also deliver to more places more rural
areas that UPS and FedEx won't deliver to and they
offer pretty good service the government you know disaster relief
for example after hurricanes and fires and so forth the
government does all these things quite well of course the
military you know the biggest the biggest argument against this
libertarian Kenard that the government can't do anything is the
military the government's whole origin is the military and the
government does the military extremely well now of course you'll
say there's corruption all this yes of course there's there's
military industrial complex corruption but that doesn't mean the government
can't do the military well the government has always been
able to do the military extremely well not just in
America but in Germany in France and Russia everywhere the
government does the military well in the militaries one of
the most complicated and difficult things to do well so
if the government is able to do the military well
if the government is able to mount an invasion of
Iraq now granted Iraq was a blunder but the actual
invasion of Iraq was executed quite flawlessly within a couple
of weeks right the military of the American military is
extremely well trained and professional how is that possible you
know how is it possible that the American military was
able to defeat the Nazis in World War two how's
that possible because the government actually is good at doing
some of these things so this ideological idea that the
government is just bad at everything it's just it it's
Payton Lee false it's just Payton Lee false you know
people will point to the DMV and say all yeah
but the DMV look I got to go to the
DMV and wait in line for an hour first of
all if you go to the DMV like actually my
DMV here in Las Vegas it's actually quite efficient they
have like a whole like they installed this new technology
system where you can you don't even need to go
to the DME you can just like go online you
can ask for a code schedule an appointment they will
actually tell you exactly what time you show up you
show up there put a little code and they just
take you like within five minutes even though there's a
giant line of people usually there and you know for
that giant line of people they actually made chairs they
made a ticketing system where you can get tickets you
don't need to stand in line you can get a
ticket there's comfortable chairs with TVs you can go sit
down wait comfortably you know have your drink go to
your car holding this ticket until they call you up
so you know even the DMV is able to do
stuff the problem is when you don't fund these things
yeah then they struggle to do stuff so imagine what
would happen to the DMV if we actually funded it
more imagine what would happen to DMV if the employees
were paid better so that they were actually incentivized to
be creative it would work it would work really well
so don't buy into this this foolish libertarian canard that
government can't do things we also need massive funding of
Arts and Sciences right now science is corrupted by corporations
this is a lot of people things this is a
lot of something that people don't understand is they thing
at all well sleeo science has the truth size is
the arbiter of the truth science for the last 50
years has been so corrupted by corporations that science doesn't
pursue the truth anymore science pursues what is profitable for
corporations to market to consumers is completely corrupt so you
wonder well how come science isn't talking about the stuff
that you're talking about how come science isn't talking about
enlightenment and Awakening and mysticism and paranormal stuff and psychic
stuff and how come you know the reason it's not
doing that is because there's no money in that relative
to the kind of money they can rake in when
the science goes towards the military or towards mining for
oil or towards you know that kind of stuff pharmaceuticals
there's no money in psychedelics even though there are more
powerful healing tools than any antidepressant there's a ton of
money in antidepressants there's no money in natural cures so
of course today science doesn't seriously study natural cures or
holistic medicine or acupuncture or yoga or meditation yes there's
a little bit of science into meditation and yoga on
the fringes but it's just it's on the fringes it's
like little pet projects that people have it's not serious
hardcore science most serious hardcore science today goes towards developing
technologies which can be directly marketed so the government can
step in here and to actually save science from the
corruption of of corporatism and capitalism because science is one
of those things that should not be done for money
or for profit science should be done for the sake
of truth and understanding but that is not how science
is done today it's very very corrupt so even those
of you who are very secular and rational and you
know often times this kind of secularism and rationalism and
atheism goes hand in hand with libertarianism what you're not
seeing is how your libertarian principles are actually corrupting the
very science that you claim to like and therefore your
size isn't accurate and it's missing all of these aspects
of mysticism and holistic medicine and so forth that are
so important towards the well-being of society of course we
need equal rights for all minorities of course we need
protections and equal rights for LGBTQ folks and we should
offer free counseling and therapy for LGBTQ people to deal
with their issues so that they can become confident raise
their self-esteem and become just ordinary members of society that's
what you would want if you if you were one
of these people we also need Supreme Court reform we
need some sort of term limits on the Supreme Court
because what we have now is is problematic I also
think we might need some sort of direct voting or
elections of Supreme Court nominees because right now this current
system we have where we have a Republican president and
then he can he appoints a Republican judge and then
we have a Democratic president appoints a Democratic judge this
is this is a silly partisan game that's being played
this is not how it should work we really need
us to figure out some way to make Supreme Court
justices seriously impartial and probably accountable to the people in
some way I haven't thought that through too much it's
just it's an idea I'm throwing out there but term
limits we definitely need maybe 12 years maybe 20 years
at most we also need more term limits for elect
government positions term limits for members of Congress I don't
know exactly what they should be we can come to
some compromise on that but we need we need term
limits in all elected government positions otherwise right now one
of the problems we have is we have a generation
in Congress that's like two generations ago people who are
in their 60s and 70s who are just like clinging
to their positions where really what we need is we
need to refresh we need to refresh Congress with new
members new faces because every new generation is is more
progressive more open-minded more conscious than the previous ones the
problem is that the old generations love to cling to
power though that's just how the ego words we need
free birth control free condom and free condoms and free
feminine hygiene products for all people who want them at
least at a basic level because this is this is
so central and this ruins so many people's lives simply
because people don't have access to condoms or birth control
or feminine hygiene this is ruins this ruin their lives
and the cost of these things are so negligible that
the government's are just handing this stuff out like candy
because it doesn't cost anything really to produce this stuff
we need mandatory paid family leave for mothers and fathers
who have new children this actually helps to improve the
education and care for new children which then helps to
create better future adults we need subsidies for daycare that
also helps to improve Society we also need to work
towards moving to a 30 hour workweek there's no reason
why we should be working 40 hours a week we
actually the whole point of developing wealth and infrastructure in
societies that we can get to work less and less
and unless we work the more free time we have
towards self-actualization consciousness work awakening and being creative and spending
time in relationships intimate relationships with our family and with
our children and our spouses that's what life should be
about it should not be working yourself to death Americans
work too much and the government is necessary to control
and regulate this because if there's no government to regulate
it then it's just like a free-for-all and the people
who are workaholics they're hard to compete with but if
the government puts a ceiling on let's say the most
you can work as 30 hours a week that would
actually help everybody because people would not be so overworked
so overstressed trying to compete companies would still have to
pay you a living wage for your work and we
have enough wealth in the country to be able to
afford that there's no reason why why Walmart couldn't cut
their employees time to 30 hours a week and still
be profitable it can easily do that same thing with
Amazon it could still do that and be profitable so
there's no reason why not one of the big problems
with capitalism is that because the structure is such that
all the wealth flows up to the top when a
corporation develops a innovative technology which helps to make work
more efficient what happens that the gains the value gains
from that efficiency that are gained through the new technology
does not trickle down to the workers it trickles up
to the owners and to the shareholders this is a
huge problem because what this means is that even though
we're developing enormous technology to make our work much more
efficient you know like a secretary who works today is
probably five times more efficient than a secretary who worked
50 years ago just because of the computers the internet
all this stuff but she still works the same number
of hours so this is a never-ending game no matter
how efficient our technology gets in the next hundred years
if we don't change the structure how the corporation is
is organized all the value and efficiency gains will just
follow up to the top producing very rich or very
rich 1% of managers and everybody else will still be
worked to death that's the problem that needs to be
addressed by government we need regulation against crunching some employers
they force their employees to crunch they pay them a
salary they're not hourly workers but then the salary basically
says that well the employer has to tell you to
do anything that you need that they need done and
so they might ask you to work for 60 hours
a week or 80 hours a week this needs to
be made illegal I know an industry that I worked
in where crunch is a huge problem and really one
of the reasons that I thought I ultimately left the
industry is the video game industry I used to be
a video game designer I worked at 2k Boston who
manufactured or designed a Bioshock but anyways you know we
we had I personally didn't experience it because I came
on board during a time where there was no crunch
but there were horror stories in that studio or to
lodge Bioshock people had to like crunch for eight months
working 60 80 hour weeks for eight months straight this
is extremely common in the video game industry but it's
also common in other industries like in in in in
the legal industry sometimes it's common and elsewhere this is
this is very very unhealthy it's not it's it's not
a conscious way to live life and it needs to
be regulated for the same reason that steroids need to
be regulated within sports because if you allow steroids in
sports then everyone has to one-up somebody else and people
just have to take more and more and more steroids
and it becomes totally unsustainable to the point where it's
impossible to even compete unless you're taking massive doses of
steroids that's sort of what weightlifting has turned into now
it's it's an abomination there are no natural weight lifters
all of them take steroids because it's not properly enforced
and regulated it's the same sort of thing with work
you know if you just allow people to work as
much as they want then what they do is you
know workaholics end up ruining it for everybody else because
then you have to compete with those damn workaholics if
you want to be a workaholic for your own self
okay fine but don't expect everybody else around you to
try to follow you to keep up with you because
you're you're throwing your life away I hope you know
that as a workaholic if you're working six to eight
hour weeks you're pissing your life away and the only
reason you're doing is cuz you're unconscious you don't know
what you're doing you don't know what healthy living or
healthy work is like it actually also hurts your work
too we need a massive education investment by the government
a complete overhaul of education like this is perhaps the
second most important item on this whole list of mine
is education I mentioned it the first is removing a
corporate lobbying and money from politics the second one is
education because education transforms everything else nothing I say here
is possible without proper education we need more schools smaller
class sizes much higher teacher incentives salaries and bonuses we
need to reduce standardized testing right now we're testing our
kids to death these tests are very mechanical and they're
testing the wrong things they're measuring the wrong metrics for
success success in school should not be measured by how
fast you should solve a math problem but rather you
should be tested for consciousness for love and for development
and for your emotional IQ that's what you should be
tested for and of course you shouldn't be tested in
some sort of ridiculous you know over-the-top way where you're
tested every month you know once in a while you're
tested for it in a soft or sort of way
but we need a massive overhaul of the education system
we need to change the subjects that are being taught
we need to end privatization of public schools the problem
with the privatization efforts of of privatizing a lot of
a lot of schools and creating a lot of charter
schools and so forth is that what it does is
it creates sort of two pools of people those who
are in private schools and those are in public schools
once all the rich people go to the private schools
the public schools now are no longer of any interest
to the to the wealthy people because the wealthy people
send all their kids to the private schools and so
then the wealthy people just want to destroy and end
public schools because they think it's not important but it
is important because the entire population needs to be educated
in a democracy you can't just have only the rich
and the elite have good education everybody else have crappy
education so really what I would suggest is that we
need one pool of schools no private schools just public
schools and we need to make them really good make
the public schools as good as the private schools because
you know what if the millionaires and billionaires were sending
their children to public schools because that was the only
option there were no private schools then you better believe
that those millionaires and billionaires would be very concerned about
improving the quality of those schools whereas right now it's
the opposite they want to destroy and take resources away
from those schools because hey my kids in a private
school and so [ __ ] the public schools who
cares about those it's very short side of thinking public
school education can be very good it can be we
just need to change the way that the public schools
are funded right now one of the biggest problems in
America is this public schools are funded by local real
estate taxes that means that the quality of the school
completely depends on the wealth of the neighborhood so wealthy
neighborhoods have the best schools poor neighborhoods have the worst
schools this is an abomination there needs to be equal
funding for all schools regardless of what neighborhood it's in
and the funding needs to be significantly higher so one
of my most important proposals here is that we need
to take the majority of the military budget that we
cut and dump it into public schools extremely high quality
public schools I went to a public school personally I
went to a really good one because I grew up
in Orange County California which is a pretty wealthy part
of California and California's a pretty wealthy part or a
wealthy state relative to other states in the country so
I was fortunate to go to some really good public
schools and without them I couldn't be here teaching what
I'm teaching right now when I think about how many
millions tens of millions of people are robbed of their
potential by not having access to high quality public schools
and it's it's it's a tragedy it's really a tragedy
we're shooting ourselves in the foot and almost no politician
is seriously addressing the the public school issue you know
as much as I love some of the politicians that
are out there right now in the Democratic side like
Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren and so forth they have some
good proposals but they're not talking about improving significantly improving
public schools that's one of the huge oversights right now
with this Democratic slave Kent and the Republicans and conservatives
forget about it they don't care about improving public schools
the the education secretary that Trump is put into office
right now is is ideologically opposed to public schools wants
to basically undermine them and defund them it's it's utterly
absurd utterly absurd total devilry and that's another one of
those things you know for you libertarians you know what
does government do well public education actually government does public
education quite well there are a lot of public community
colleges public universities like in California we have a great
public university system I went to a public university UCI
quite good you know it's not Ivy League but but
quite good quite affordable relative to Ivy League schools so
we need more of that all across the country and
you know I got a great public education it's possible
it's just a matter of funding it's not that it's
difficult to do government can do public education public education
is not rocket science it's just that you have to
have the will and the funding to want to do
it you have to prioritize it if you give schools
the funding pay teachers much better structure the curriculum properly
you're gonna have excellent public schools this is not some
that's like some far-fetched utopian idea this this is already
existing there are already great public schools all across the
country they can be replicated we also need to change
how we teach in these schools rather than teaching content
to be memorized we to teach more for wisdom and
for discovery we need to teach children not what to
think and what to believe but how to think school
needs to be much more exploratory where you're discovering things
for yourself there also needs to be a lot more
input and choice for the children in the schools so
that they can choose their own subjects so they can
pursue the things that they're naturally passionate about because not
all kids are equally passionate about all subjects of course
schools need to incorporate and start to teach mindfulness meditation
mysticism spirituality yoga and consciousness this is absolutely central this
is the whole point of school the whole point of
school is to teach consciousness and wisdom and self-actualization and
right now school is teaching none of it so basically
if I had my wish right now you know if
I had a magic lamp and I had three wishes
one of my wishes would be to take all of
the stuff that I teach through actualize that org and
to make it freely publicly available and taught in school
entire classes we need to have classes on metaphysics classes
on epistemology classes on yoga classes on meditation classes on
mindfulness classes on emotional mastery classes on philosophy classes on
psychology classes on spiral dynamics and developmental psychology classes on
sociology this would completely transform education it would also make
education much more practical much more interesting and students would
be much more passionate about it because all these subjects
are extremely interesting and they all directly relate to your
own life soft development and self-help needs to be the
core of school and everything else is a tangent is
of course we're going to teach math I'm going to
teach English and I'm going to teach history yeah we
teach all that stuff but all of that is secondary
to the primary aim school which is to teach you
how to be a conscious wise independently critical thinking human
being we will also teach basic life skills like cooking
nutrition healthy eating fitness exercise we will also teach business
and marketing skills so that you're able to exit school
and actually start your own business for example basic finance
skills need to be taught how to do your taxes
how to calculate interest rates and make sure that you're
not over budget and this sort of stuff there needs
to be a massive push for teaching relationships conscious relationships
conscious communication skills and conscious marriage skills this would be
a huge improvement to society my god how much collective
suffering is created because in school we are not taught
at all about conscious relationships communication or marriage we also
need to be taught about masculinity and femininity how much
devilry comes about because people don't have a proper understanding
of masculinity and femininity so many problems so many self-esteem
issues so much demonization of the other side you know
a lot of toxic masculinity is is popular today the
red pull movement and all the sorts of stuff because
they simply don't understand femininity have a demonized some identity
and then females could also stand to understand masculinity more
and then this also would help with LGBTQ issues as
well because a lot of those have to do with
finding your balance on the masculine feminine spectrum and it
is a pretty wide spectrum parenting skills need to be
taught whether in school or in college or maybe there's
there's special community college programs you can take for parenting
skills this would be huge we have so many parents
raising children who have no basic understanding of parenting skills
the ecology of parenting I have an episode called how
to raise Rockstar kids which I wear I talk about
some of the psychology of parenting we need conscious politics
to be taught in school as well so all of
this does four part series this needs to be taught
in school this needs to be standard knowledge for anyone
graduating high school for any voter think about the quality
of voting that we would have people were taught all
this stuff that I'm talking about we also need high
quality sex education and drug education not fear-mongering about drugs
but high quality science-based drug education we also need to
expand study abroad programs so that people actually don't just
go to school here but actually you're you're required before
you're a Jew eight high school you're required to spend
at least six months studying abroad in Japan in China
in Russia in in the Middle East in Europe you
know in South America so that this promotes tolerance of
multiple cultures and opens one's mind grows one's mind significantly
of course spiral dynamics and developmental psychology need to be
taught to everybody because it's so central to understanding how
human beings work and very importantly you need to be
taught how to find your life purpose if I was
in charge of school I would have as one of
my goals that by the time you leave high school
every child has found their life purpose and knows what
they want to do career-wise so everything I talk about
in my life purpose course that would just be part
of the standard curriculum in school in high school it
would be taught over multiple years you would be guided
to find what it is that you really want to
be doing in life that would enormous ly optimize the
kind of work people do right now literally hundreds of
millions of people in this country are working dead-end jobs
simply because nobody properly guided them into finding their true
life purpose and because of this they're wasting 90% of
their creative energy working this dead-end job where they could
be doing something there a [ __ ] about and
not only earning more money but creating more value for
the world and be happier about themselves having a higher
self-esteem being more passionate inspiring others to be passionate being
more loving this is absolutely central and it's not taught
in schools right now at all so I'm I'm really
passionate about the schooling topic it's it's a massive topic
in and of itself and man it's just it's just
so important it's it's a travesty and a tragedy that
we're not investing billions more dollars into this and it's
just so obvious - if it's so utterly obvious that
this would improve society there's no question about it there's
no question I think we need free college free universities
and free trade schools for everybody the argument for free
university is exactly the same argument as for free high
school why is it that you're okay with free high
school but you're not okay with free college what's the
difference there is no difference in the modern world modern
society high school is not enough to be competitive in
the global marketplace with all the technology that we have
you need technical skills you need higher education you need
college everybody should go to college and of course college
should also teach more practical stuff and if you don't
want to go to college you want to just become
a tradesman we need to have trade schools that chishu
specific trades that you want to be an artist learn
that if you want to be a plumber and electrician
go to a trade school learn that instead of college
if that's what you want right so set that we're
forcing you to go to college but we're offering you
choices and then you get to choose what you want
to do but the whole point is that by the
time you get out of college or out of a
trade school you need to be set up with the
skills you need to have a job to have a
sense of life purpose a sense of direction a sense
of security a way to meet your basic survival needs
because if you're not able to meet your basic survival
needs that hope that holds the entire country back because
then you're depressed your egg see you're leeching off people
you're then more likely to to scam people to exploit
people to take jobs that are not high consciousness what
kind of people work for exploitative corporations the kind of
people that have no other option because they have no
other higher sense of life purpose because no one has
helped them to find it it's society's job to help
people find it the reason this is not just an
individual's job but a societal job is because this stuff
is extremely tricky and complicated we can't expect the majority
of people to figure the [ __ ] out you
know I've been very fortunate in my life to be
able to figure some of this out for myself out
for myself but this stuff is so extremely tricky and
complicated sometimes and and just you know sometimes I'm like
damn I was so lucky to just stumble into this
stuff the way that I did because the majority of
people never will and it's a tragedy that they're missing
out on all this amazing stuff we need to change
markers for measuring national success no longer is national success
gonna be measured by GDP but by happiness by love
by consciousness and by corruption indexes we can track these
things we can develop tests for tracking consciousness development level
happiness level capacity for love and corruption index of a
country we need to track these every single year we
need to post them publicly so everybody sees how well
we're doing and where we need to improve of course
we need to end a drug war because it has
not been successful it's been proven to not be success
when you legalize marijuana we need to legalize psychedelics we
need treatment clinics for addiction there are powerful psychedelic tools
like ibogaine mushrooms LSD v Mao DMT which are proven
to be extremely effective at curing addiction hearing alcoholism curing
a heroin addiction opioid addiction ibogaine is the best opioid
addiction treatment that exists it's absolutely proven beyond a shadow
of a doubt the problem is ibogaine is a psychedelic
and is illegal in America absolutely disgusting that that's the
case but that is the case so we to not
only legalize psychedelics we need to popularize psychedelics we need
to have psychedelic education we need have psychedelic clinics available
in all neighborhoods where you can go in there are
trip sitters there they will provide you with free psychedelics
the psychedelics are totally pure any psychedelic you want this
there are classes and courses that you can take that
train you how to properly take psychedelics so that you
don't freak yourself out and then you are guided by
experts by experienced trip sitters and Psychonauts in these various
clinics they will guide you and show you how to
how to trip properly how to have profound mystical experiences
how to raise your conscious now to develop yourself how
to cure your depression cure your anxiety cure your panic
attacks your your PTSD experience God and all this just
this one change the psychedelic links if we implemented this
this would transform all of society within a few generations
which is precisely why people resist it so much we
need massive funding for small business and entrepreneurship take away
the subsidies for large corporations that don't need them give
them to young budding entrepreneurs who have new exciting ideas
for new inventions and technologies we need massive funding for
objective journalism journalism is getting corrupted and squashed under this
rampant capitalism that we have right now much of cable
news is not really journalism its clickbait and sensationalistic news
it's tabloid news this lack of serious objective journalism in
mainstream media is seriously harming the entire society in all
of our political discourse and there need to be serious
protections for journalists so that journalists can do the reporting
without being prosecuted persecuted or threatened by government officials or
anybody else we need massive funding for broadband internet in
rural areas in America we need to increase the budget
for space exploration and the reason we need to do
that is for two reasons first of all because well
actually three reasons first of all because space exploration that's
a huge new business field that's going to be opening
up in the centuries to come so government helping to
spur that on is great because it's gonna help the
economy also is gonna help to develop new technologies as
we push ourselves to the cutting edge of what's possible
with space exploration that will push NASA to develop new
technologies those technologies then percolate and trickle down to the
rest of society this has been shown to be true
with with various kinds of work that nASA has done
in the past with the moon landing and so forth
also because it's inspirational the human race needs something beyond
itself to work towards it can't just be us here
trying to get rid of poverty and trying to you
know have a better more comfortable life and driving a
faster sports car it can't just be about that it
needs to be about something higher something higher is exploring
the outer reaches of space maybe even finding outer you
know life in outer space maybe even beginning to interact
with it in some way all this stuff might sound
like science fiction but it's going to happen it's just
a matter of time so we might as well we
might as well embrace it III think it's also important
that we fund some sort of meteor defense system NASA
should be working on a system to protect us against
asteroid or meteor strikes this is a very serious problem
and we can pitch in all the all the different
government agencies space agencies from around the world can pitch
in the Europeans the Indians the Chinese the the Japanese
can all chip in to build this defense system because
this could literally wipe us out in a single day
and it's directly related to our survival we need better
funding for national parks museums and monuments we need a
much stronger consumer protections agency which was recently developed by
Elizabeth Warren a presidential candidate right now the Consumer Protection
Agency is at a brilliant idea we need to massively
expand it and massively fund it it protects consumers against
various kinds of corporate shenanigans and fraud against banks exploiting
you with various kinds of fees and loan sharking and
all the sort of stuff I think we also need
a special agency like the anti-corruption enforcement agency that specifically
hunts out corruption within government within police with in all
areas of public and corporate life and roots that [
__ ] out because corruption is is the greatest enemy
when it comes to health care we need free health
care for all at the point of service nobody should
die because they lack money in a conscious society nobody
would be allowed to die or go hungry for lack
of money that's only possible in a selfish unconscious society
we need cheap government produced generics for drugs once once
a drug is no longer a brand drug after the
patent expires you know the corporation's have a 15-year patent
or so once that patent expires the generic should be
heat just like dirt cheap health care is not an
industry where you gauge people for money we need also
a massive push on preventative care funding for preventative care
this will reduce a lot of sickness and disease and
increase creative potential across the board we also need serious
research and development in holistic medicine and then the education
of holistic medicine across the board holistic medicine needs to
be taught in schools and universities it needs to be
taken seriously not snickered at and called whoo-hooo a new
age because this holistic medicine can save millions of lives
improve millions of lives it's just a no-brainer I also
think we need free gym access we have a huge
obesity problem in America free gym access for all I
also think we need a technology safety testing center so
new technologies and gadgets are being developed all the time
you know we have 5g wireless telephones coming online people
say that there's going to be problems with radiation from
that who really knows the problem is that we're developing
technologies faster and faster but they're not really being tested
for safety there needs to be a government agency whose
whole job is just to test new gadgets new technologies
all the emerging stuff that's coming out if there's cloning
if there's genetic engineering if there's AI you know man
computer interfaces you know all this stuff is coming virtual
reality various kinds of different websites social media sites that
are very addictive all of this needs to be tested
for safety new kinds of chemicals new plastics that are
used new materials that are invented every single year that
are used in in consumer products all this needs to
be tested for safety and you know individuals can't do
it and no nor no corporation is gonna do it
because it's not to their benefit to do it government
has to do it we also need strong funding for
national emergencies and disasters and strong training and preparedness earthquakes
hurricanes tornadoes fires and so forth droughts floods we need
to give humanitarian aid to terrorist countries so those countries
that have the most terrorists rather than bombing them we
need to offer them a lot of humanitarian aid show
them our benevolence and love by giving them food and
helping them out in all sorts of ways getting the
medicine giving them gadgets and technology and solar panels and
all this and if we do that then those countries
will start to actually like America rather than to hate
America because we keep drone striking them of course they
hate America with all those drone strikes we need to
work to help to elevate other nations without exploiting them
for profit right now America's foreign policy on the surface
it proclaims to want to spread democracy around the world
but actually what's happening is that giant corporations have hijacked
our foreign policy and are using it to strong-arm developing
countries in order to extract profit from them to exploit
them their labor force and their natural resources this needs
to end this is the worst kind of devilry no
conscious government would allow this our interventions abroad should not
be military for the most part and they should be
humanitarian helping to uplift those nations that need it the
most we should not be engaged in the overthrow event
of any foreign governments this should be illegal for the
CIA to to be engaged in foreign governments are sovereign
governments let them do what they do if there's a
dictatorship or something we got to tolerate that dictatorship as
long as they're not attacking us let them work it
out they got to go through their own growing pains
you can't just topple a dictator and then install a
democracy it don't work that way because the dictator was
elected by low consciousness underdeveloped citizens so toppling him is
not going to solve that problem as Iraq and Syria
and Afghanistan have shown us it's just gonna be a
waste of money and it's only going to provoke those
people and make them more angry for invading their countries
and overthrowing their democratically elected governments and regimes I think
we need a few more constitutional amendments we need one
constitutional amendment that guarantees the right to alter one's consciousness
the government shall not abridge one's right to alter one's
consciousness this is really a corollary to the government shall
not abridge your right to the practice of religion because
religion really is about altering one's consciousness and of course
this would protect the criminalization of things like psychedelics we
also need some kind of constitutional amendment that specifically guarantees
privacy rights against electronic surveillance and protects our data from
giant corporations like Apple Google Facebook and so forth so
there needs to be some serious constitutional protection for that
and from NSA warrantless wiretapping and spying which is completely
out of hand and obnoxious social media platforms need to
be treated as public utilities so Facebook is a public
utility YouTube is a public utility Instagram and so forth
and search search engines need to be public utilities so
Google is a public utility they can still run the
show they can still make money off of it but
there there are gonna be there's now going to be
acknowledged that these are way too massive and too important
to simply be under corporate control and that there needs
to be significant public oversight over all of these platforms
to ensure that they're fair unbiased and not overly corporatized
certain marketplaces digital marketplaces also need to turn into public
utilities for example Apple's App Store the Amazon Marketplace perhaps
places like eBay these are really public utilities and they
also need to be over sited and protected against various
kinds of corporate exploitation and shenanigans the government needs to
fund serious research into mysticism meditation spirituality psychedelics paranormal phenomena
and psychic phenomena massive research needs to be done in
this and the reason government needs to be the tip
of the spear and lead the way is because there's
not a lot of money in this for business so
this is perfect for the government and also because this
is direct this is directly related to the whole point
of government which is to help elevate consciousness how can
you help to elevate consciousness when you are ignorant and
you don't have enough science and research on meditation yoga
mysticism spirituality psychedelics paranormal stuff psychic stuff all of this
stuff is real and it's worth studying and researching and
investigating seriously with hundreds of billions of dollars I want
to see clear scientific research about which meditation techniques are
we are better for which people which psychedelics are best
for which types of illnesses and problems how they work
exactly and all of that needs to be figured out
I want to see massive funding for recycling programs I
want to see a ban on nuclear power because frankly
we just don't need it it's dirty its problematic earthquakes
and tsunamis create all sorts of radiation problems meltdowns and
so forth as we've seen in Japan and Russia and
elsewhere we can do just fine with solar energy by
subsidizing solar energy I don't think we really need nuclear
or anything else balanced budgets for you conservatives I'm a
big balanced budget guy in this way I'm different than
most liberals and Democrats who just are are happy with
with with running up a giant deficit and a giant
debt I'm not at all I think that we need
to have balanced budgets in the government of course you
can't implement that overnight it's not realistic right now but
you know in the longer term 50 years from now
I foresee that the government will have some some stipulations
and regulations for it that like we have to balance
our budget we can't overspend we can't just tax future
generations of children we got a balance our [ __
] just the way that cities do and states do
and individuals do so must the federal government and if
that means higher taxes then so be it higher taxes
but we're gonna have a balanced budget and the reason
that is is because if we don't balance our budget
and our deficit gets way out of hand there's going
to be economic consequence this leads to potential recessions depressions
collapses at least to anxiety and lack of confidence in
the system it leads to down ratings of our bonds
and and and credits by by national rate rating agencies
and so forth so it's it's not healthy to be
overspending I think we also need to change the way
that fines are issued for breaking laws fines will no
longer be fixed prices or fixed amounts but rather a
percentage of one's net worth so for example if I
once heard a story that Steve Jobs when he was
alive and he was running Apple you know he was
a billionaire he had a lot of money and he
would like to drive really fast and he would like
to park like in illegal illegal ways I guess it
was like parking in handicapped cells or something or he
would just drive to probably combination of those and but
he didn't care he would get so many tickets he
didn't care because of course you know for Steve Jobs
paying $500 for a speeding ticket or $200 for a
parking ticket is nothing whereas if you're poor if you
work at Starbucks earning a minimum wage and you get
a speeding ticket for $500 that's like 10% of your
entire net worth right there this is completely unfair because
the whole point of a fine is to disincentivize some
activity so when you get wealthy enough basically all the
fines that exist for poor people are completely irrelevant to
you and no longer serve as a disincentive that means
you can act like an [ __ ] with impunity
so what I propose is that the fine is a
percentage of your net worth so for example if Steve
Jobs is caught speeding the fine in the law is
not defined as $500 the fine is defined as 2
percent of your net worth so Steve Jobs if he's
caught speeding he'll have to pay 500 million dollars now
that's the proper incentive and it's fair and it's proportional
because hey you know when a poor person earning minimum
wage is caught speeding to them that's a life and
death problem to them that $500 fine daddy is like
5 or 10% of their net worth that's that's big
for them and they actually need that money more than
Steve Jobs does because Steve Jobs if he if he
has to pay 5% of his net worth for a
speeding ticket he's still gonna have billions left over he
can he can survive just fine but when a poor
person has to pay 10% of their net worth they
might not have enough money now to feed their children
you see I think we also need to do this
with bail right now rich people can just get off
on bail cash bail whereas poor people cannot so bail
needs to be set as a percentage of one's net
worth so if a billionaire goes to jail he's gonna
he's gonna pay like a hundred million dollars bail not
just a million because a million for a billionaire is
nothing he doesn't sweat it at all I think we
need serious gun background checks I don't want to ban
all guns I think we should have handguns and so
forth but they need to be properly issued which means
that you can't have a gun unless you go through
a mandatory rigorous training program that teaches you about gun
safety you got to take the course pass the test
just like at least you have to do with the
DMV only then can you buy a gun when you
buy a gun there's a national registry of all guns
so the government knows how many guns you have what
kind of guns you have where you purchased them and
so forth and you got to pass some mental safety
checks so mental health your mental health you have to
have a clean history you can't be an abuser of
children or you can't you can't hit your wife and
own a gun you can't have a mental illness that
owned a gun you can't be on antidepressants and own
a gun and this sort of stuff this is just
very basic this is not really a ban on guns
the government is not coming for your guns so don't
give me that [ __ ] we just need some
sensible background checks and safety measures also all guns should
should have some kind of locking mechanism that locked them
to prevent children or unauthorized users from from using those
guns maybe it's a bio bio sensor biometric sensor fingerprint
sensor or it could just be a physical lock but
you know as technology improves it'll probably be a biometric
sensor so that only the person who the gun is
registered to can fire that gun I think we also
need to make US territories States or allow them to
go their own separate way and be independent so Puerto
Rico needs to be turned into a state or be
made independent same with Guam and certain other US territories
that exist because it's unfair that they don't get proper
representation in Congress at the federal level companies who outsource
jobs to other countries to try to get cheap labor
have to be barred from getting subsidies and government contracts
so if you want to outsource your job to India
or Bangladesh and you're a US company fine do it
but you will never get a subsidy or a government
contract ever again so it's your choice what you want
to do you can't have it both ways I think
we also need free kindergarten in pre-k it's very important
I think we need to equalize taxation for online stores
and brick-and-mortar stores because right now Amazon and other online
stores are killing brick and mortar stores simply because of
the taxation loophole that's there the taxation should be equal
and it still isn't for many online stores I think
it's also very important that we regulate AI facial recognition
genetic engineering and man-made or man-machine interfaces because all of
these are going to be huge developments in the future
that have serious abuse potential corporations will definitely abuse this
stuff if they can if they're not checked I think
we need a public forum for serious policy discussion right
now there is no public forum for serious policy discussion
we have cn we have MSNBC we have FoxNews maybe
a few other mainstream news sources a few newspapers and
none of them have serious policy discussions they're full of
ads they're full of spin they're full of stupid partisanship
we need something that's non-ideological non partisan non corporate where
there are you can tune into it it's maybe it's
an online channel website a cable show don't know what
it is but some sort of forum where people can
have serious discussions about public policy that doesn't exist right
now and it's very problematic I think we need a
special regulation on predatory advertising and marketing we need to
ban junk food ads ban all pharmaceutical ads ban all
military industrial complex propaganda ads ban all fossil fuel ads
and banner ads on all credit cards and payday loans
my reasoning behind this is the exact same reasoning as
to why there is a ban on cigarette ads and
there is a ban on alcohol ads near schools for
exact same reason because all of these industries and all
of these advertisements are advertising extremely exploitative unconscious unhealthy products
and services which most people don't recognize as being problematic
so they're like traps people fall into the junk food
trap to the pharmaceutical trap into the fossil fuel trap
into the payday loan and credit card trap and all
of this has made a million times worse by the
advertising that these companies are able to do on cable
TV on YouTube across the internet in newspapers magazines and
so forth there's no reason to advertise this stuff we
don't need to ban junk food but you shouldn't be
able to to advertise it as blatantly as its advertised
these days on TV same thing with all those commercials
works like ask your doctor for this antidepressant or for
this pill or for that thing or these ads that
are run by these fossil fuel companies or they try
to sell you know how generous they are and how
much charity they do and actually how they're not evil
you know fossil fuel companies but they're actually working towards
green energy this is just propaganda this should not aloud
we need to have a department for the regulation of
advertising and marketing we need to bring truth and integrity
and consciousness to advertising this is a huge problem I
also think we need a department in the government for
the empirical testing of public policy which means that any
public policy which is enacted will be split tested and
it will be carefully monitored and then those results will
be delivered back to the people and to the politicians
so that we can then make better informed choices so
for example if we if we legalize marijuana for 10
years this department this empirical testing Department will will actually
track all the results track the deaths track the overdoses
track the addiction potentials track all that track the economic
statistics and then at the end it will issue a
report which will say here's exactly what happened whether it's
a overall positive or negative did it hurt the economy
helped the economy that it increased deaths decreased us how
did it how did it affect cancer how to defect
diseases how to defect depression mental health now shootings all
of this needs to be tracked you know you can't
track it perfectly but we got to start doing this
and also we got to start split testing policies so
one of the benefits of having multiple states is that
we can have like one state legalize marijuana while another
one doesn't and then we can compare those after five
ten years and see what the results are we can
have one state banned guns another state not banned guns
and then test that and see what the results are
and then from that we can make empirical policy decisions
in this way we remove the partisanship from from from
politics and also we make compromise easier because now we
can just say like well those of us who are
for legalizing marijuana and those who are against if we
really believe that our position is right we should be
able to to put our money where our mouth is
and actually be willing to empirically test it so like
I'm perfectly happy to empirically the legalization of marijuana for
ten years and if the results come out that the
legalization of marijuana ends up hurting people more than it
helps people then let's roll it back and let's ban
it if I'm wrong and I could be wrong I
don't think I'm wrong I think that if we legalize
marijuana it will it will overall it'll be on that
net positive but I'm not sure about that we got
to test that right because we can always be tricking
ourselves so this goes for all of the policies that
I mentioned above if anything that I measured above is
implemented and split tested and it turns out to not
improve society not improve conscious and not improve love make
things worse increase corruption then we Nix it and we
try something else that's empirical politics overall I want to
say that the whole scheme that I'm laying out here
is an end to capitalist materialist hoarding and exploitation that
does not mean an end to capitalism this is an
evolution to a more conscious form of capitalism a more
ethical and more moral form of capitalism capitalism can't stay
still like everything has to evolve this is capitalism that
now incorporates some socialistic elements but it's still not socialism
I'm also considering a ubi I like the idea of
a ubi we need to have a robust welfare system
in addition to the ubi I think the problem with
the ubi is that if you're only proposing the ubi
as a replacement for everything else that I said that's
a no-go that doesn't work you can't replace some of
these things that I've said with cash a lot of
the things that I talked about here are way more
valuable than cash there's no amount of cash you can
give a person to buy some of the things I
talked about no amount of cash will buy you clean
water no amount of cash will buy you a a
good education and and you know eliminate corruption in government
no amount of cash is gonna do this for you
so a ubi has to be in addition to various
other social safety nets basically what I'm aiming out here
with with all these policies is that we're trying to
get society to a point where all of the basic
needs of a human being are fully satisfied food shelter
school college education day care child care medical care retirement
disability your job your career all of that is basically
made easy and effortless within society now of course this
is a long-term goal we can't do this in the
next election cycle I'm talking about a few hundred years
into the future this is what society is moving towards
we're also moving towards a more world government more global
cooperation of course individual countries will still retain certain individual
sovereignties and rights in the same way that states do
within the United States individual states still have a lot
of power within the states but there will also be
an overarching umbrella government and the key to that is
we want to get to a point where we have
a global military force one global military force where the
individual forces of individual nations are abolished and the reason
we want to do this is because this will save
us an enormous amount of waste within military right now
countries waste hundreds of billions of dollars every single year
on useless weapons of mass destruction just for their own
personal defense in case they get attacked or they want
to attack somebody else and this is so wasteful and
they need to do that and they're all doing it
because it's sort of an arms race so the whole
point is that if we could get everybody T in
the world to unionize and to start to agree that
we don't need to attack each other anymore to the
point where we completely eliminate the possibility of war and
what we have then is we just have a global
military force which we still need in case you know
some bad actor erupts but this will be a rare
occurrence in this way we will be able to save
a massive amount of resources for every country and those
instead of being used on external Wars and battles we'll
be able to use be used internally to improve the
infrastructure of the country and do all the other stuff
that I've talked about and in this way we will
actually end up cutting taxes so in the short term
the stuff that I'm talking about will raise taxes on
people especially on the rich but also even on the
middle-class it'll raise taxes to be realistic but in the
long term what we're altima to is actually we're going
to end up having lower taxes in total than we
have right now in let's say a hundred years after
we have a unionized global government in a global military
force and we abolished the American military force and the
Russian military force and so forth and that is maybe
a huge turning point in human history and human evolution
that will be as important of a turning point as
was the development of individual nations out of city-states back
during you know the Roman times during the Roman times
there were no countries there was no Italy there was
no Germany there were provinces and really not even provinces
but cities individual city-states those city-states unionized because they realized
that it's it's much more efficient for us not to
have every neighboring city fighting each other you know how
inefficient that is when every city has to build a
[ __ ] wall around itself extremely inefficient well the
same problem is happening right now at a national level
which is why global government is not only important and
good and necessary but it's absolutely inevitable so those of
you who are against globalism this is the sort of
anti-globalist trend that I see amongst libertarians and assertive x'
this is a no-go you're gonna lose that battle you
can resist globalism all you want but first of all
it's not the evil that you think it is really
the evil that you attribute to globalism is what I'm
talking about with corruption when we improve the corporate corruption
problems and we make government more transparent then globalism is
not going to be the evil that you think that
it is and this will save us an enormous amount
of resources if we're able to eliminate war between different
nations in the same way that we have eliminated war
between different cities have you noticed that different cities don't
fight with each other like New York and Los Angeles
don't [ __ ] launch weapons and missiles at each
other California doesn't launch missiles against Texas why is that
precisely because we've unionized at a higher order and that's
what all of reality is doing its creating unions at
a higher order this has been happening to our all
of human history is gonna continue to happen so don't
resist it embrace it and reap the benefits all right
that's it for all my policy proposals I still have
some more concluding remarks let's take an intermission right here
and I'll be back with with those okay now I
want you to notice a few things about the things
that I just said up above first of all I
want you to notice how tangible many of these policies
are and so here is where the rubber meets the
road and we're conscious politics becomes very practical and it's
not just utopian philosophy even though of course some of
the things that I said will be difficult to implement
because there will be a lot of resistance from the
status quo and of course some of the things I
said can sound utopian because it might take 50 or
100 years to implement them but but also a lot
of things that I said are very practical can be
done today I also want you to notice that the
purpose of all of the policies that I mentioned is
actually to increase freedom so if you love freedom that's
what I'm talking about here this is not designed to
create some oppressive world government which rules you and dominates
you this is not what this is about this is
an increase in freedom but you have to understand that
freedom is a complex nonlinear counterintuitive thing and that we
need to strike a delicate balance it's not just as
simple as anybody do whatever they want that doesn't really
truly create freedom to truly create freedom you have to
hold in check and you have to create limitations strategic
careful limitations upon certain elements of a system such that
there is more freedom for other elements of the system
you see by meeting people's basic needs by providing a
basic social net safety net by by providing quality education
quality health care and some of these other things by
limiting corporations ability to influence and corrupt politics yes those
are all strategic limitations which on the surface might seem
like oh no Leo it's not freedom it's oppression but
look at what it gives you it then creates an
environment in which you're able to truly have new more
complex orders of freedom how free are you really if
you don't get a proper education how free are you
really when corporations have bought out your entire government using
billions of dollars of lobbying money are you really free
in that situation how free are you really when a
corporation is free to dump toxic radioactive chemicals and rivers
is that really freedom I want you to start to
appreciate the complexity of freedom it's not nearly as simple
as your libertarian ideologies and conservative ideologies have led you
to believe I also want you to notice very importantly
that none of the above that I've mentioned is yet
proper socialism of course if your conservative you might interpret
what I'm saying is socialism but really it's not and
I myself am a capitalist I enjoy earning money I
enjoy having a profit I enjoy entrepreneurship and small business
ship I enjoy all that and generally I think that's
a good thing and I want to encourage more of
that I don't want to take that away but also
we have to acknowledge what happens when business becomes excessive
when corporatism becomes excessive and starts to corrupt the whole
system so the reason that all the stuff that I
said above is not really socialism is because the proper
definition of socialism is public ownership of the means of
production that means all the factories all the companies are
actually privately or publicly owned rather than privately owned and
I have not said that I think that's a problematic
idea I think there's some interesting ideas there some nuggets
of truth but also it's problematic I wouldn't want to
just blank it say that we should eliminate all private
ownership of the means of production there's problems there so
in my system private property is still strong you can
still start a business you can earn a business you
can run a business you can have employees you can
earn good money most industries in my system are still
privately run so even though it might sound like I
said oh god the government gets to do a lot
of stuff the government gets to manufacture generics the government
gets to run the post office the government gets to
do various research and development to things and so forth
and run the space program there's still plenty of room
for private industry in all this and still the majority
of industries are going to be private privately run it's
really only the giant businesses that are being heavily regulated
as they should be having giant businesses monopolize the marketplace
to the point of eliminating all competition which is exactly
what they're incentivized to do because a business wants to
eliminate all competitors that is not healthy capitalism and in
fact Adam Smith talked about this he talked about the
the need to carefully regulate capitalism so that it doesn't
just dominate and rake the entire game in its favor
or corporations don't do that you're still allowed to make
good profits you still can be a millionaire you can
even become a billionaire under my system but you will
pay more for it and it will be harder that's
right because if it's harder for you to become a
millionaire and a billionaire that means it's easier for people
who are not earning that much to survive so there
has to be some trade-offs here so this notion that
somehow olio why do we have to inconvenience the millionaires
and the billionaires because the whole point of this discussion
we're talking about what is the proper redistribution of resources
resources in society are always being redistributed there's no such
thing as like well if we leave it all alone
then there's gonna not gonna be a redistribution of resources
no the game is always about distribution of resources so
the question is what's the most healthiest harmonious balanced most
conscious way of distributing resources making it harder to be
a millionaire in a billionaire is a good thing for
society not a bad thing because what that means is
that then it's easier for working-class people to be in
the middle class yes it's a bit of a drag
on millionaires and billionaires but you know what tough [
__ ] there's bigger problems in the world to worry
about than billionaires and millionaires also notice that this encourages
what I'm talking about these policies are designed to encourage
creativity art science and innovation it's designed to encourage small
business entrepreneurship because large corporations actually suffocate out small business
entrepreneurs so by putting them in check it makes it
easier for you to start your business and to work
for yourself which is what I want so here's my
ultimate vision for a government the goal is not for
government to take over your life nobody cares about that
nobody wants that it's not like somebody's sitting here and
saying okay what kind of policies can we imagine for
government to take over your life this is a straw
man this is not we're talking about the goal the
goal of government is to make strategic decisions - unwritten
and to create a system which is a fertile environment
for creativity exploration independence flourishing autonomy health harmony fairness consciousness
love peace and happiness that's what we all want so
then the question becomes what kind of policies helped to
do that and I think the ones I listed above
are good candidates now they need to be tested out
and the details of course matter about how they're implemented
and we need to find the right priorities in which
to implement them we can't do them all at once
because it's way too much but generally this should lead
to creating an environment where the rules are set in
such a way that then human beings are able to
do what they want to do live the kind of
life they want to live see right now you're not
able or many people in America are not able to
live the life that kind of they want to live
because they're stuck in crippling wage poverty or wage slavery
or they're stuck with huge medical bills which they can't
do anything which with and it makes them go bankrupt
or they're stuck you know babysitting their children because there's
not proper health care or child care that's available to
them daycare mm-hmm or they have to work a dead-end
job because they didn't get a good education when they
were growing up because they were they just happened to
be born into a poor car a part of the
country where the taxation scheme the real estate taxation scheme
was such that their school wasn't properly funded you see
so we're trying to fix that and create a more
fair system now many of these changes that I'm proposing
require significant cultural changes and this is the thing that
annoys people especially many conservatives and traditional people it makes
traditional people uncomfortable that we have to make all these
cultural changes because they want their culture you know to
stay as it is because they're attached to the culture
but guess what culture is always changing you're always evolving
always has always will be you can't clean the culture
that's a losing battle I understand though that some people
can feel attacked when we start talking about changing culture
especially changing it to radically or to quickly I understand
that people get scared of new stuff and if they're
not totally open-minded then they perceive it as as a
negative and so that's why we have a lot of
these culture wars and a lot of what conservatives are
reacting against with the social justice warriors and the liberals
and progressives is there a reacting not so much against
the policies because the policies would actually be helpful to
many conservatives you know raising the minimum wage to fifteen
or twenty dollars an hours that would be helpful to
many conservatives in rural parts of the country that would
be a really good wage for for many people who
live in rural areas because you know $15 doesn't get
you very far in New York but $15 gets you
very far if you're living in the middle of nowhere
working at McDonald's in Alabama that's that's that's more than
a living wage in Alabama or in Texas and other
parts of the of the country so a lot of
these proposals would help conservatives the problem though is is
they get they get hung up on the cultural stuff
and it's like well but but Leo I don't want
to be one of these social justice warrior hippie peace-loving
no pacifist a New Ager type of people it's just
kind of soft its feminine this is this soy boy
sort of approach to the world you know it's soft
its kind of weak it's it's emotional its kind of
feminine and womanly and girly yeah you're opposed to a
sort of a cultural shift so really your objection is
not based on the policies it's based on identity you're
attached to certain identity certain hyper masculine identity or no
macho identity a certain traditional identity trying to preserve your
heritage preserve the way things were preserve a certain set
of you know libertarian ideals that you hold so this
is one of the greatest obstacles that we're facing here
again like I said this is why we can't have
nice stuff to have nice stuff we have to be
willing to let go of the stuff that we're clinging
to and this is where identity becomes such a central
issue in all of personal development all spirituality all of
life revolves around what you're identified with and so like
I said for society to evolve individuals have to evolve
and what is the individual evolution but the surrendering of
limited identities to expand into larger ones likewise what is
the evolution of a culture or of a society but
the surrendering of various collective identities that people are attached
to it's very much like a lobster or a crab
or a snake shedding its shell or its skin it
goes to various growing pains and when it first sheds
that skin you know it has this hard carapace this
Lobster has this hard carapace which protects it from the
world but then it has to shed that and in
the process of shedding it first of all that process
is uncomfortable it takes a while but then after it
sheds its old carapace its new carapace isn't fully hardened
yet its kind of soft and it feels vulnerable that's
right that's how growth is done but that's necessary because
the old carapace was so rigid it was it was
literally stopping the muscles and then all the meat and
the bones in the in the in the lobster from
growing and expanding to a larger size this is exactly
what's happening with you individually as you're doing self-improvement and
exactly what's happening politically collectively as well with our culture
so let me address some top objections here that people
have about what I'm proposing the first one is this
but Leo won't all these benefits that you're trying to
give to people you know free health care free education
free this free that you bi all these nice things
won't this make people lazy and soft and weak what
will people do once government provides all their survival needs
and benefits what's left in life are they you're just
gonna be like lazy sitting around watching TV and smoking
weed is that what you envision no not at all
you don't understand how the human psyche works if you
have this objection what these people will do is they
will self actualize you see as we meet the basic
needs of life we're meeting the survival needs and then
the life doesn't end at meaning your survival needs life
then becomes about shifting from tier one meeting survival needs
to tier 2 which is working on being needs and
these are the most profound and the most rewarding needs
to work on it's no longer about making sure your
children are safe making sure you can pay your electric
bill and making sure you have enough food in your
fridge these are all very crude animalistic barbaric sort of
needs once you've got all that taken care of now
it becomes about all the other great stuff about life
the most rewarding stuff it becomes about a sense of
life purpose it becomes about helping others and helping your
community it becomes about building something greater than yourself it
becomes about creativity it becomes about art it becomes about
science for the sake of understanding it becomes about philosophy
it becomes about self-actualization it becomes about then ultimately self
transcendence and spirituality and mysticism and consciousness and then ultimately
it becomes about just a pure radiating of love once
you've completely gone beyond all of your needs all of
your physical needs once you don't even care about physical
existence once you have transcended the need to even be
alive in a body your life becomes about exuding and
radiating and embodying the highest forms of love and this
is where life becomes the sweetest this is where true
happiness is found this is what every human being really
wants but does it know that they want because it's
so far out there and they're so far away from
it because they're just so wrapped up in survival that
it's not even on their radar they don't have enough
vision to see that and what actualize that aura is
about it's about helping you to self actualize and to
live a life from being needs not from survival needs
so in this sense this is an advanced teaching and
actually a lot of you what you need is you
need more fundamental simpler less advanced teachings which just teach
you how to get your survival needs met but in
a sense I'm teaching advanced stuff to advance people here
that's the objective so I skip over a lot of
how to meet your basic survival needs I could have
a whole channel devoted just how to meet your basic
survival needs and you guys would love it I would
have millions of subscribers you guys would pay me millions
of dollars for that information I don't do it because
I've risen above it and it's not really that interesting
to me also because you can find that information elsewhere
there's plenty of their channels and books and courses that
have been written most of self-help is about that I
cover more metaphysical topics more advanced stuff the stuff that
is that is very very tricky and so I also
what about what I also do is I help you
to make the transition from survival needs to being made
so we do kind of talk about both and talk
about how to move up but so the point of
society doesn't end with satisfying your basic needs people are
not going to become lazy rather people will finally become
free to pursue be NEADS and they will finally discover
what life is really about they will become powerful creators
artists innovators scientists inventors healers and explorers right now less
than 1% of the population in America are powerful creators
you only become a powerful creator once you transcend many
of your survival needs and the reason that we have
so few powerful creators is because the very structure of
our our economy in our society and our government is
such that it incentivizes manipulation and exploitation of human resources
rather than original creativity and true original providing of value
this is not part of our culture our culture doesn't
even make such distinctions in our culture it doesn't matter
how you earn money as long as you earn lots
of money good that's how our culture looks at it
in the future our culture will change such that earning
lots of money will no longer be a significant achievement
rather the significant achievement will be how are you earning
your money are you being a powerful creator that's massively
contributing to the improvement of your society and then if
you earn money for doing that great that's what we
should really be interested in not just earning money because
it's very easy to come up with a scheme for
how to exploit people out of their money people do
it on Wall Street every single day credit card companies
do it pharmaceutical companies do it doctors and hospitals do
it insurance companies do it every single day and they
don't even blink an eye to them it's totally normal
because our culture just says hey this is the only
way we have so few people that are powerful creators
that nobody even teaches you how to be a powerful
creator in school nobody tells you in university nobody tells
you you can go to Harvard you can go to
the best universities and no one will teach you how
to be a powerful creator only if you're lucky you'll
stumble upon it by yourself by accident maybe you'll figure
it out but the majority of people won't rather what
these universities will teach you how to do is how
to exploit people and when you go into business after
university they'll teach you how to exploit people to maximize
profits at any cost regardless of any value that you're
adding to the world or not this is what needs
to change don't worry about people being lazy people are
not going to be lazy people are gonna become spiritual
and this is exactly what we want next objection but
Leo if people start stop struggling with survival what will
motivate them if the fear of survival is gone how
will they accomplish anything how will they get out of
bed in the morning again this is a very low
consciousness way to think about human motivation you're thinking about
human motivation as though you can only live a good
life if you're constantly threatened and scared by imminent danger
know what will motivate such people who aren't struggling anymore
is there mo gonna be motivated by love creativity art
beauty science and life purpose these are the higher consciousness
motivations most people have ever lived a life while tapped
into these motivations but this is where the good life
is at living out of fear and scarcity sure it
could motivate you but that's a very crude barbaric animal
form of motivation it's much better to be motivated by
a genuine desire to be creative to be artistic to
want to make beautiful things to want to discover new
inventions or new scientific discoveries or to to go explore
new planets and find new life-forms this is this is
how you want to live your life and then sharing
all of that sharing your abundance with others this is
what makes you happiest that's love having a sense of
life purpose doing something meaningful rather than just going to
work punching a clock and flipping cheeseburgers that's what makes
you satisfied in life living out of fear and desperation
this makes you depressed miserable anxious petty angry hostile even
suicidal next objection but leo if government is corrupt doesn't
that we need that doesn't that prove that we need
less government why are you suggesting more government that's good
only worsen the problem again this is a misunderstanding of
the problem the problem is not that government is corrupt
the problem is the corruption within government so yes there
is corruption within government the solution is not to eliminate
government because if you eliminate government guess what corruption is
not going away all you're doing is you're just now
removing that balance of power such that all the corruption
will now be unchecked in the corporate sector the corporate
sector is totally corrupt government is a check on that
even if the government is corrupt it's still a check
on the much larger corruption within the corporate environment so
the solution is not to reduce government the government needs
to be as big as it needs to be to
manage the complexity of the society that we have as
we have more people of course government needs to grow
so this idea that we need to reduce government while
the population is exploding and while complexity and technology is
exploding and accelerating this is not going to work what
we need to do the solution is to remove the
corruption from government and yes that is possible that is
what's been happening throughout the course of all human history
so if you feel that government is hurry up right
now you have no idea how corrupt it used to
be 50 years ago 100 years ago five hundred years
ago a thousand years ago two thousand years ago you
have no idea the kind of corruption that existed so
we've actually come very far and so this is not
some utopian idea that we can remove corruption from government
this is this has been going on for thousands of
years since the beginning of human civilization corruption has been
slowly removed from government and it's been getting better of
course it's been ups and downs but overall there's a
clear trend and that trend is going to continue so
whether you're on board for it or not government will
become less corrupt in the future with your help or
not with your help it will be better though if
you got on board and you were on the right
side of history here and you saw the trend lines
and you saw what evolution was moving towards which is
consciousness and love and consciousness and love is the opposite
of corruption because corruption is selfishness and consciousness and love
is selflessness so I'm talking about anti-corruption here just be
careful not to conflate corruption with governments these are two
different things there can be government's that are very corrupt
and there can be government's which are not corrupt see
likewise corruption is not a property that only applies to
governments it applies to business and it applies to individuals
and it applies to religions it applies to organizations keep
that in mind so removing government is not going to
remove corruption the prob of corruption is extremely deep and
really it's the problem of selfishness which is of course
what we're tackling directly with all of our self-actualization consciousness
work when we work towards awakening the next suggestion is
but leo taxation is theft this is a talking point
at libertarians really love they hold it as a dogma
and it's a very pernicious idea that taxation is theft
taxation is not theft because the very notion of theft
and property rights does not exist without a government so
what libertarians don't understand is it there's no such thing
as property rights in the natural world in the animal
kingdom in the animal kingdom the strongest prevail might is
right the whole point of government in society is to
mollify that and to make it a little bit more
manageable insane and comfortable there are no property rights if
you're just living by yourself in the forest because you
say that you own your tent and then if I
come in there with a gun I get to say
that I own your tent and if I have the
gun I win that's how it really works that's how
property rights get invented and established and codified and then
reified as though they are real you see so taxation
is the it's a cost that you pay for the
property rights that then government secures for you so it's
not that taxation is just something that government is stealing
from you that you deserve rather your ancestors gladly made
the trade-off between paying a little bit of Taxation for
the safety and security and property rights that government provides
rather than living in a [ __ ] jungle where
anybody could come and enslave you rape you robbed you
at gunpoint as long as they were stronger and bigger
than you had more power and more technology than you
and more people than you see so this is a
very reasonable trade-off also when you say the taxation is
theft you're completely ignoring all the benefits that government provides
to you such as roads bridges military protections postal services
and many many other things you know natural disaster relief
who's going to protect you from a hurricane or from
a wildfire or from an earthquake or from a terrorist
attack when it happens who private company's not gonna do
this there's no there's no money in it for them
private companies for example do not provide flood insurance the
US government the federal government has to provide flood insurance
because it's a net loser it doesn't earn them money
so private companies don't want to do it so and
even when a private company does insure you you know
how private insurance works if you've ever had to file
an insurance claim oftentimes they try to screw you over
and deny you coverage when you need it they'll find
various loopholes and of course they structure the contracts precisely
that sort of sneaky manipulative exploitative way such that when
you do really need the insurance coverage because your house
was destroyed by a hurricane they'll find you know there
are lawyers they're well paid lawyers will find some little
loophole in the contract that says that all well you
know the rain damage from the hurricane doesn't really count
that's separate that's flood that's technically a flood so if
during a hurricane your house gets flooded well we're not
responsible we're not going to cover it dad that's the
kind of shenanigans that that these insurance companies will will
play you see and so this think of just think
about how problematic this is if this is left unchecked
so taxation yeah it's something you have to pay but
also don't ignore what you get back in return for
it now the next objection but Leo with this high
taxation that you're promoting here or on the wealthy what
will motivate the millionaires and the billionaires to continue doing
work and building corporations and providing jobs to people because
after all EO it's these millionaires and billionaires these inventors
these Bill Gates's and Jeff Bezos and Steve Jobs's which
create all the jobs for the lower people so you
tax them too much they'll stop creating jobs again this
is a misunderstanding of human psychology first of all these
millionaires and billionaires they already have enough money that they're
not doing it the money Jeff Bezos is not doing
what he's doing for the money Bill Gates is not
doing what he's doing for the money Steve Jobs was
not doing what he was doing for the money so
that already misunderstands what drove these people these people were
driven by a desire for power maybe a desire for
fame for success for creativity for artistry for entrepreneurship for
the challenge of it for a sense of life purpose
that's what drove these people not the millions and billions
because if that's what drove them they would have quit
their jobs uh decades ago they don't need to work
Bill Gates doesn't need to continue to work Jeff Bezos
doesn't need to continue to reheat that he can comfortably
retire on tropical island and live his life in luxury
forever why doesn't he precisely because it's not about the
money what drives higher consciousness people is like I said
artistry creativity progress science a sense of life purpose a
sense of mission and ultimately love and consciousness and selfless
service you know why do I run actualize I don't
is it because I need the money no is it
because it's the most profitable thing that I could do
no there are far more profitable things I could do
with my time if I went into some corporate sector
I could be making millions of dollars more than I
am now it's because this is my selfless service this
is my love this is my cut my consciousness this
is what I'm doing this is what you do once
you've met your basic needs you need something higher to
satisfy you so here I am so what will motivate
these millionaires and billionaires the same thing that motivates me
love and consciousness and selfless service and actually this will
be a this will be a welcome to trade off
this is exactly what we need at a certain point
you stop being motivated by money shallow people are motivated
by money profound conscious people are motivated by love and
by selfless service and kind and that's what we need
to promote more of so raising the taxes and some
of these people is not going to stop them from
building companies from inventing new technologies from doing science from
hiring employees they're not gonna stop they'll keep doing it
because it's in their DNA to keep doing that that's
who they are that's who they want to be they
enjoy that that's their psychic payoff the payoff here is
not money the payoff for a human is the psychic
payoff that you get from the work that you do
see the money is just the money is only important
to the extent that it meets some of your basic
survival needs once it's done that you don't need any
more money you don't care about it doesn't motivate you
at all I barely think about money anymore it's not
an issue it just gets in the way it gets
in the way of really living life now of course
if you're stuck in survival mode then a lot of
what I'm saying here is above your head and you
know you're so desperate for money that you you might
think Holly oh how can you say this well that's
right because your basic needs haven't been met yet so
I'm talking about a society which will help you to
meet your basic needs so you don't need to be
like a starving dog or a homeless person that's right
if I go to a homeless person and I tell
the homeless person about mysticism or enlightenment or about spirituality
or about God or about art creativity and love is
he gonna care no because he's too hungry that he
needs to meet his basic needs first before he can
care about that stuff but if we feed him we
clothe him we bathe him we clean him up we
educate him we give him all the stuff that he
wants we give him some affection we give him some
friends we give him a nice house we give him
a car he we give him some sex all of
that then after all that he's gonna say okay well
I had enough of that I can only have so
much of that you know I'm not gonna keep stuffing
my belly full of food forever there's only so much
food you can eat at an all-you-can-eat buffet at some
point it becomes sickening and then you say okay so
I've exhausted that what's next and then you discover creativity
art beauty philosophy science life purpose law of consciousness spirituality
God and all that and that's when your life really
becomes amazing next objection but leo this sounds so utopian
in the short term it might sound utopian certain elements
of what I say then again a lot of things
I say are practical even in the short term but
remember I'm presenting a long term big picture vision I'm
thinking about where humanity is headed in the next 100
to 500 years that's my time frame and of course
the only reason I can have such a long time
frame is because I'm not thinking about it from my
selfish point of view I'll be dead long before many
of these things that I'm talking about are actualized and
it doesn't matter to me because I'm not living from
a place of a personally satisfying you know my own
basic needs of course I have higher needs that I'm
satisfying so I'm still not totally selfless but but this
allows me to have a long time horizon and this
is going to happen regardless of whether you're on board
or not like I said evolution cannot be stopped it's
moving towards higher love and consciousness and higher organization higher
horns this will happen this is the trajectory of history
so you might think that these things that I say
here are utopian and impossible actually not only are they
not impossible they are absolutely inevitable it's just a question
of time if your time frame is ten years then
yeah everything I say here is utopian impossible if your
time frame is 500 years then everything I say here
is obvious and inevitable and in 500 years future generations
of humans will take everything that I say here as
totally and they will take it for granted they will
not even be able to imagine what it was like
to live in the 21st century and to be shocked
by some of these radical crazy progressive ideas that Leo
was putting forth they're actually gonna look back at what
I said in this video and they're gonna say oh
my god he was so he was still so conservative
and he was still so barbaric and backwards compared to
where we are now 500 years later that's how it's
gonna look that's always how its looked look through history
that's how history looks the next objection but Leo they
tried doing what you said in the USSR in the
Soviet Union in North Korea in Venezuela and other parts
of the world with communism and it failed so what
you've tried here has been disproven and debunked or what
you're advocating here has been disproven and debunked actually that's
not the case what was tried in the Soviet Union
North Korea and Venezuela all of these countries were grossly
underdeveloped extremely corrupt staged orange or rather staged red by
the name of stage red and stage blue at best
the things that I'm suggesting here are not possible in
a staged rant or stage blue society doesn't have enough
consciousness doesn't have enough development and it's too corrupt it's
too selfish for these kinds of policies to work these
kinds of policies can only be implemented in a post
Orange Society a post capital society that doesn't mean we
completely eradicate capitalism but it means we have to go
through capitalism exhaust capitalism to its limits realize and become
conscious of the limits of capitalism of how capitalism eats
itself and then move towards something beyond that that's what
I'm talking about so many of these ideas here that
I'm talking about will not work for an example in
the Middle East because Middle East is not yet evolved
to stage orange but many of these ideas will work
in Europe especially in northern Europe and in America because
we are already at orange and we are pushing past
we're ready to move past so I'm talking about the
next stage of evolution for some of the most developed
countries in the world African countries it's still too early
for them to implement all the stuff that I say
here although it does show you a little bit of
an idea of where you're headed it's just that it's
gonna take you longer and you need to you need
to go back and focus on building basic infrastructure a
basic court system uncorrupted a police system you know firefighters
roads highways trains airports interest you need to build that
stuff build businesses on an entrepreneurship and universities and and
get good at science rather than theology you know have
a decent Constitution in your government get rid of gangs
and violence and and mafias and cartels deal with all
that then you'll be a stage Orange capitalism and then
you'll be able to evolve beyond that once you realize
the limitations of capitalism so the stuff I'm saying here
has not been tried in the Soviet Union or North
Korea or Venezuela but it has been tried in Northern
Europe in the Scandinavian countries it has been tried in
in Canada it has also been tried in certain progressive
cities and states in America like in California in Washington
in New York and it's it's worked there it's not
an accident that Washington State New York State and the
California State are some of the wealthiest states in the
in the country you know California things like the fifth
largest economy in the world just the state of California
rather successful and a lot of people want to move
there and live there it's not an accident because they
they have more progressive governments people want to live that
way the benefits are very clear and very proven so
don't go confusing this with Venezuela and North Korea that's
very silly also the style of government there is totally
different the Soviet Union North Korea and Venezuela many of
these were totalitarian dictatorships really run by dictators they were
not democracies what I'm talking about here is a democracy
before you implement the stuff that I said here you
need a working democracy first which we already have in
America it's got problems it's got corruption and stuff but
we got a democracy here so we got to go
to the next level the next subjection but Leo are
you advocating for equality of outcome or equality of opportunity
here which is it aha I caught you this is
the this is the silly a Jordan Peterson talking point
as if any reasonable person would ever argue for total
equality of outcome nobody is talking about equality of outcome
nobody is talking about making everyone's salary identical this is
ridiculous this is a straw man what we're talking about
is equality of opportunity the problem that folks like Jordan
Pederson don't understand is that equality of opportunity is something
that is not a given we are very very far
away from equality of opportunity and one of the ways
that we fix the equality of opportunity is by looking
at the outcomes so how do you judge equality of
opportunity well not in the abstract it can't just be
a philosophical thing you have to actually look at the
results that people get look at people's incomes and so
forth that doesn't mean I'm gonna equalize everybody but it
does mean that we do have to look at outcomes
we have to look at you know how are african-americans
doing relative to white people how are rich people doing
relative to poor people we have to consider these various
things how are inner-city kids in schools doing relative to
kids and private schools in wealthy areas you got to
consider this and then looking at looking at the outcomes
the outcomes show you where the system is rigged such
that then you can change the system to then produce
more equal opportunity I think there's a fantasy amongst libertarians
and conservatives and folks that subscribes Jordan Peterson's ideas that
while Leo we've already solved the the equality of opportunity
and now all these social justice warriors want is they
want equality of outcome and that is a fantasy that's
ridiculous and that's beyond the pale but that's not what
the social justice warriors want what social justice warriors want
is equality of opportunity not outcome that's a straw man
and a misunderstanding of social justice warriors really what a
social justice warrior is is someone who wants a more
fair equal society that's less rigged towards the wealthiest at
the top and towards those who have traditionally had a
lot of power which is white men white men that
had a lot of money so I mean what do
you want do you want to be anti social justice
it's a bit ridiculous when you when you really think
about people who complain about social justice warriors fighting for
social justice has been the cause of basically all political
movements since the dawn of time starting from like the
Jews rebelling against the Egyptian pharaoh in the Bible you
know thousands of years ago and like the Spartacus gladiator
revolt against the Roman Empire and you know Jesus standing
up against the Roman Empire and the Jews in the
corruption there and you know Martin Luther King and Gandhi
and the and Martin Luther during the Protestant Reformation you
know what is political history what is human history but
the standing up against gross and justices standing up against
slavery standing up against various kinds of apartheid and and
segregation and Jim Crow and oppression of women like this
is this is human history here fighting for social justice
standing up against the Nazis fighting the Japanese what is
this about but social justice worrying about the Holocaust wanting
to end the Holocaust this is social justice this is
what we're talking about equality of opportunity no one is
asking for equality of outcome you're still gonna have to
work for it in this society that I'm imagining you
still gonna have to work hard in fact you will
work harder you will work harder than you do now
flipping burgers at McDonald's because when you're flipping burgers at
McDonald's you can just do that like a robot can
do that it's mindless work what I'm talking about is
doing conscious work having a sense of life purpose really
caring deeply about your work when you care deeply about
your work you're more motivated you work harder you work
longer but of course you also enjoy it more it's
more satisfying to it doesn't numb your mind as much
it's not so robotic and enslaving next question or objection
but leo aren't some people just doomed to be failures
and fuck-ups and even the best government programs won't fix
them I agree I'm not saying that we can fix
everybody I'm not saying that if all these policies are
implemented it's gonna be a utopia and everyone's gonna be
enlightened and everyone's gonna be loving and there's not gonna
be any poverty or or crime or anything there will
still be poverty in certain areas there will still be
crime there will still be diseases there will still be
some exploitation there will still be some option it's not
gonna be perfect far from perfect it's just gonna be
better and yeah certain people with mental illnesses certain people
who you know we're may be abused as children they
may be they might be irredeemable certain people who want
to be criminals certain people who just have totally closed
mine who are ideologues who are subscribed or severus kinds
of radical ideologies and religions and cults yeah you're not
gonna be able to fix all those but the point
is not to fix everybody the point is to create
an environment a system of regulations and rules and and
infrastructure to make it easy for the majority of people
to evolve and then of course there will always be
some people who fall through the cracks due to their
own failures their own laziness their own you know lack
of interest or apathy or whatever it is yeah that
will happen but also acknowledge this that right now we
literally have tens of millions of people in this country
not to mention around the world as a whole that
are squandering their lives because they lack the proper infrastructure
and the proper equality of outcome or the equality of
opportunity like good education decent health care and and other
basic things like this a decent minimum wage which would
help them to rise up and to lift themselves up
by their bootstraps I love the idea of being independent
and lifting oneself up by one's bootstraps but also I
recognize the limitations of that idea that idea doesn't solve
all collective problems and you gotta acknowledge that too so
the government is not going to lift you up by
your bootstraps for you the government is gonna provide you
the boots and the knowledge and information you need so
that you can pull yourself up that's what we're talking
about but Leo won't all this be resisted vehemently by
the status quo and therefore impossible to implement yes on
the first part it will definitely be vehemently resisted by
the status quo but it's not impossible to implement it's
gonna be difficult there will be a ton of resistance
it's gonna be like pulling teeth at times and you
will be demonized for trying to make these reforms as
people throughout history have been demonized like Jesus Gandhi Martin
Luther King and so forth all these people were demonized
for the for the good work that they tried to
do and the reforms they tried to make but like
I said it's inevitable if you don't do it somebody
else is gonna do it this is what society is
working towards its improving itself this is evolution there's always
resistance to change and so that doesn't mean that we
don't try to change and sometimes you got to fight
for change I don't mean you have to physically violently
fight although even sometimes that is necessary as we see
throughout history a lot of violence in the name of
social justice and improvement of society but just fight you
know fight with your ideas fight with your conventions with
political activism or whatever fight for what's right fight for
progress fight for improvement that's life that's evolution it's a
fight some lose some win but in the end the
overall scheme is that things are improving getting more complex
and becoming more whole and more unified at higher levels
and the last objection but Leo this is so radical
what you're saying here this is even more radical than
the social justice worse and even more radically than your
typical leftist here's what I'll say about that don't judge
it whether it's radical or not radical that's not the
issue the issue is what's right what's gonna lead to
higher consciousness into more love that's what's right and if
we happen to find ourselves in the dark ages in
a barbaric time then yeah solutions which lead to consciousness
and love will seem radical when you're stuck in a
[ __ ] greatness seems radical when you're barely able
to make ends meet some vision of being a millionaire
seems radical seems impossible that's how it is that's why
vision is one of the most important things greatness is
a radical thing highly conscious people throughout history have been
radical visionaries they have talked about things way ahead of
their time totally misunderstood by the majority of people rejected
by the mainstream of society demonized burned at the stake
stoned to death this is what happens with visionaries because
selfish people are scared of selfless people people who are
small-minded and low conscious and underdeveloped they are scared of
developed people they are scared of consciousness and they're scared
of love they cling to falsehood illusions delusions ideologies selfishness
exploitation because they directly benefit from it and because they're
so needy that they need the fruits of that exploitation
to fuel their life because without that what do they
got nothing so yeah this is sort of radical but
then again Jesus was radical in his time Gandhi was
radical in his time Martin Luther King was radical in
his time and then in hindsight now judging from where
we are today all of these people and they're there
their general visions have been vindicated and have inspired millions
and have improved the lives of millions and billions of
people of course they were also demonized and bastardized and
and misunderstood you know if Jesus were certainly so corrupted
in later centuries that it's also led to the deaths
of millions of people but that's the nature of of
progress a lot of people misunderstand the most progressive and
visionary people Devils and selfish people they will take the
visions of visionaries and then they will reduce them towards
their own selfish needs and purposes to exploit others which
is a lot of what happened with Christianity and the
teachings of Jesus you have to really appreciate that you've
been brainwashed by the status quo and so the reason
I'm the reason the things I say seem radical is
because you've been brainwashed by the status quo and the
status quo is us living in the dark ages right
now we are the dark ages we're not out of
the medieval times we're in the medieval times it's just
that because everybody around you is so bought into the
brainwashing in the status quo that you you lack the
contrast to see it and because your friends your family
your teachers and co-workers and everybody you know around you
is as equally brainwashed as you by the status quo
nobody ever questions it and so therefore when somebody comes
forward and proposes a radical powerful great vision it tends
to be dismissed as utopian or impossible or outrageous or
sacrilegious or something like that but the fact is that
mankind has only actualized 1 to 5% of his full
potential most human beings are born and they live their
whole life and they die and they never even knew
that they only lived up to 5% of the potential
of mankind this is true individually but it's also true
collectively of society so I'm here to tell you that
there's there's a there's much more potential to actualize here
for you individually and for us as society so don't
don't claim too much to the past we got much
greater things ahead of us we want to make sure
that we don't let the as they say the enemy
of the great is the good see so what we
have right now is good what we can have in
the future is great and then there's even levels beyond
that but you have to be willing to be open
to that and not to cling too much to the
stuff that you're comfortable with right now growth is uncomfortable
whether its individual growth or collective growth and we're seeing
that right now especially in American politics with Trump and
with all these debates between the social justice warriors the
anti social justice warriors the alt-right the the left that
progressives the centrist the concern of it in all of
the neo cons the all of this this is growing
pains this is how growing is done so now the
final question is what do you do about all this
how do you take all this information and you make
it something tangible and actual first of all stop blaming
and demonizing others for the problems of society accept responsibility
for collective issues go beyond shallow partisan debates notice that
all ideologies whether left or right are inadequate and partial
then get to some work educating yourself about these topics
read books watch videos you could spend a few years
just doing that the way that I have study history
philosophy sociology psychology spirituality social science economics developmental psychology study
all this stuff so you can go beyond the partisan
debates we need you to be informed we need you
to have a sense of history to understand many of
the complex topics that I've brought forth in these last
four episodes here find high-quality sources of news and journalism
don't just be skimming through YouTube or through your Facebook
posts on you know stupid news about politics but like
find some good sources some high quality newspapers magazines whether
online or or physical these sources do exist subscribe to
them pay some money every month 5 10 bucks a
month pay them whatever they need you know support them
because we need more high-quality objective journalism these days it's
very important and right now journalism is under attack yeah
so these sources exist out there I recommend you you
research them and subscribe to them and pay a little
bit of money for them also make sure that you
vote that's probably the most important practical thing you can
do after you've educated yourself go vote but don't just
vote in a general election for president also vote in
the primary elections vote for your favorite candidates also vote
and do research not just on presidential candidates in the
primaries but also on representatives congressman elected judges mm-hmm you
know Treasuries and other other various kinds of more minor
roles that most people are completely clueless about and apathetic
towards you know research that study it find find your
local government officials talk to them get involved it's more
than just voting speaking of voting you might wonder well
Leo who do I vote for you didn't tell me
who to vote for it's actually very simple about who
to vote for who you vote for is simply the
person that you perceive as the most loving the most
conscious the most selfless and the most spirally developed the
most morally developed that's the person you vote for nothing
else really matters their policies what they promise it's somewhat
important but not very important what matters is their level
of development and consciousness so vote for that person whoever
you think that is now if to make a proper
assessment you have to be objective you have to step
outside of your ideology outside of your personal preferences your
selfish needs your cultural clinging and various kinds of dogmas
that you have and you need to study Spile dynamics
to understand what development levels look like so you can
quickly analyze people you know you should be able to
look at a politician on a debate stage and quickly
judge you know which politician based on the words they
use and the ideas that they convey which of the
mistakes red stage blue stage orange stage green stage yellow
and so forth and then you pick the highest one
and you vote for that person I also recommend that
you start to donate to the most conscious candidates and
politicians whoever you think those are both at the federal
level but also at the local level don't forget how
important local and state politics are it's not just about
who's president or whose senator local matters as well and
consider volunteering or even running for office in this last
election of 2018 this off year election we had a
lot of new people volunteering for for running for office
but volunteering and then also running for office and some
of them actually got elected and one like Alexandria Acacio
Cortes and and many others and I foresee that more
of that will happen a lot of young people running
and winning a very diverse group of people men I
mean women people of color gay people lesbian people so
I mean the doors are open right now and one
of those I think the the benefits of what Trump's
victory in 2016 a woke people to is the fact
that we've gotten very complacent about our politics the reason
Trump won is because we've gotten so apathetic and so
careless and mindless about politics we just expect politicians to
do everything for us without any engagement ourselves so we
don't volunteer we don't donate we don't follow the news
we just we just say that's um that's somebody else's
problem not my problem but democracy don't work that way
if you want to run that kind of government then
what you want is not to live in a democracy
you want to live in a dictatorship in a dictatorship
somebody else from above dictates to you how you should
live but see you don't want that because if you
live in that situation you quickly realize how terrible it
is and you start to [ __ ] and whine
and moan but the the flipside is that when you
get your democracy which your ancestors have fought and died
for and bled for to give you this democracy and
then what you do is you are so apathetic that
you can't even be bothered to vote in a primary
election or to read a [ __ ] newspaper of
some serious journalistic reporting rather than watching some some stupid
partisan bickering back and forth on cable news you know
if you're so apathetic and lazy that you're not going
to do that you're so nihilistic that you think all
government is bad assignment worth your time to study this
stuff and it's it's a distraction well then you get
exactly what you deserve see you're being irresponsible you're not
really helping to pull government up by its bootstraps see
it's not the case that only individuals pull themselves up
by their bootstraps the government itself must do that as
well and how does the government do that through your
actions through your volunteering through your running for office and
this can be a sense of life purpose speaking of
life purpose is trying to help perpetuate conscious government and
conscious politics the last few things that I think you
should do is you should check out my book list
and read the books all the books I don't have
that many of them in the politics subcategory and in
the systems-thinking subcategory and also about spire that image go
read all those that will give you a decent foundation
and then of course lastly what you need to do
is you can't practice conscious politics unless you yourself elevate
your consciousness so do all the stuff that I talked
about normally with actualize an org actualize yourself transcend yourself
awaken yourself new consciousness work meditate yoga all this sort
of stuff purify yourself of your own devilry selfishness and
corruption because corruption isn't just some force that exists out
there perpetuated by some evil globalists corruption starts with you
you are the corrupt one and if you don't work
on yourself to get rid of your corruption then why
would anybody else why would you expect anybody else to
and that's how we come full circle from self-improvement and
spirituality to politics and government and then all the way
back to self-improvement and spirituality alright I'm done here please
click the like button for me there and come check
it actualize that org where you will find various resources
including the blog the book list at the life purpose
course the forum where we discussed this stuff I suggest
you follow along on my blog because I post new
insights and videos there that I share I'm gonna be
posting more political examples so over the next month or
two I will be sprinkling various political examples into my
blog videos and so forth so that you get a
better sense of how conscious politics intersects with self-improvement and
what's really going on in the world today in the
news and inner politics and then that's it for this
series of course I could still say a lot more
and I probably will have some more episodes about political
topics maybe I'll talk about racism maybe I'll talk about
gender issues maybe I'll talk about environmental issues in the
future but overall we're returning back and I'm gonna be
talking more about awakening talking more about self-improvement emotions love
there's some amazing videos that are gonna be coming up
in the future some very deep stuff that I haven't
said yet and so I'm really glad that I got
all this politics stuff out of the way because it's
sort of been on my mind and in my heart
for a while now for a few years and I've
been kind of holding back because I was I was
hesitant at first I didn't want to mix politics with
spirituality because I thought like maybe that's too much of
a distraction and it can be it definitely can be
so be careful not to get too distracted by this
stuff but also understand that we can't keep these things
separate we can't not if you want a decent conscious
government how do you expect government to be conscious if
we never talk about spirituality and politics together can't happen
so fear not we're coming back to original topics what
you really signed up for but also I hope this
has expanded your sense of understanding of spirituality and self-improvement
you can see how how everything is so deeply interconnected
that you can't really separate these things out and you
can't just say well Leo I'm just gonna do self-improvement
and focus on myself and screw everybody else and everything
else that can work when you just get getting started
that's fine you can do that for a few years
but at some point you got to bring it back
and got it start to tie it all together you're
gonna start to see that you're part of this larger
super organism you have some larger responsibilities that this is
not a drag it's not a negative thing it's not
something to be bummed out about this is actually an
exciting opportunity for your life purpose and for ultimately your
spiritual purpose which is to be an example of consciousness
and love you
