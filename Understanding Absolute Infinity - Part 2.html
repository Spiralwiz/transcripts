hey there Leo here for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about understanding absolute infinity
part two [Music] you welcome to part two let's continue
where we left off last time with part one make
sure that you watch part one before you watch part
two because we did so much work in part one
that you're not going to be able to make sense
of pretty much anything that I talk about here alright
so in part one we did a lot of very
heavy metaphysical lifting and we basically explained what absolute infinity
is so you have a pretty good idea about that
now in part two what I want to do is
I want to talk about many of the interesting and
juicy historical connections and discoveries of absolute infinity what is
sort of an embarrassment to history and modern education is
what you're going to discover in this episode is that
there are all these remarkable intelligent wise people throughout history
over the last two and a half thousand years who
have discovered and cognized absolute infinity and have talked about
it in numerous different ways and yet they don't teach
you this in school they don't even largely teach you
this in university you probably don't know any of this
stuff which is why this is a such an exciting
episode I'm really excited to bring you some of these
um historical figures and the different angles at which they
came at Absolute infinity from and let's just jump right
into it and let's start with the most important figure
I think in history when it comes to absolute infinity
and that is a man by the name of Georg
Cantor he was a mathematician and logician and his dates
are 1845 to 1918 so fairly recent most of his
work was done in the early 20th century and what
he is famous for is that he is the father
of set theory set theory is a domain of mathematics
which you don't really learn about until maybe you get
into advanced mathematics and logics courses in college and on
the surface it sounds like a very simple sort of
thing a set is simply just a collection of items
any kind of items so you could have three cats
five dogs ten cars twenty trees a billion people a
hundred billion galaxies or stars you know whatever so this
is basically how we do arithmetic as we group objects
into sets and then we perform operations on those sets
we multiply them divide them add them subtract them compare
them to each other find relationships between them so Kantor
formalized this study of set theory and what's interesting about
set theory is that it sort of straddles the fence
between the domain of mathematics and the domain of logic
and set theory these days is actually very fundamental to
understanding why math works the way that it works the
very like basic metaphysical aspects of math are largely talked
about in set theory and if you really want to
understand why does math work the way that it does
lies is so fundamental and perhaps so accurate in describing
reality well you might want to study set theory but
set theory is a relatively recent invention and it could
not have come about other than through Georg Cantor now
the amazing thing about Cantor is that he wasn't interested
in just the regular numbers like 1 2 3 4
5 nor even just the rational numbers or the irrational
numbers he was interested in infinities what is infinity and
what's interesting if you go back through the history books
and you take a look at how mankind and mainstream
culture viewed infinity even in the sciences and in the
mathematics up until Georg Cantor largely infinity was aboard it
was seen as a scandal to the sciences and to
the mathematics nobody took infinity seriously because the standard line
of thinking was that nothing is actually infinite everything we
know is finite therefore talking about infinities is just some
sort of flight of fancy or some kind of speculation
or some kind of mental magic voodoo and so no
serious scientists really thought about infinity that is until Gareth
Kanter came along and he blew the whole field wide
open he turned mathematics on its head and these days
in the history of mathematics he might be considered one
of the most important mathematicians of all time and yet
in his day he was denounced criticized and largely rejected
for his discoveries so before we talk about the scandal
that happened there let's talk about what he actually discovered
so Cantor was interested in infinite sets imagine a set
of objects which contains an infinite number of objects how
do you deal with that so he was just curious
about numbers and so he said to himself okay let's
start with just the natural whole numbers like one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten a million
a billion a trillion to infinity right so even in
elementary school we can see that the number line continues
forever and these are just the whole numbers we're not
talking about rational numbers ratios or decimals here or even
the negative numbers we're excluding all those so let's just
take the natural numbers and let's use that as our
baseline so we can see that that's infinite and then
the question occurs to us okay what if we took
just the even natural numbers so 2 4 6 8
10 and so on to infinity would that be a
larger or a smaller or identical number of numbers as
the natural infinite numbers so see Cantor was trying to
compare sizes of infinity and he made some very counterintuitive
discoveries there so as I'm explaining this to you I
want you if you haven't learned about this yet from
somewhere else I want you to just kind of play
along in your mind and just return a guess the
answers and see how good your intuition is going to
be because I'll give you the answers in a minute
here so you think do you think that even numbers
are smaller or larger or the same as the natural
numbers interesting question but Cantor went further he said okay
what about the rational numbers and by rational numbers what
do we mean we mean ratios like 1/4 1/5 1/2
1/3 3/4 and so on to infinity so what do
you think about that do you think that there are
more rational numbers than there are whole numbers or than
even numbers remember each one of these goes to infinity
so they're all infinite so are they then the same
or are they different sizes of infinity what do you
think take a best guess what does your intuition tell
you and then Cantor considered what about the real numbers
the real numbers are all the decimal point possibilities on
the number line so point zero zero zero zero zero
zero zero zero one would be one real number and
point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero two would
be other real number and you can see if there's
a ton of real numbers just between zero and one
not to mention if we go from 0 to infinity
how many real numbers there are so what do you
think do you think that the amount of real numbers
is larger than or identical to the whole numbers and
the rational numbers and the even numbers okay so make
your predictions because here I'm going to tell you the
answers these answers came out to be very counterintuitive and
yet Cantor was able to deductively prove this in very
rigorous logical mathematical language so here's what he discovered he
discovered that in fact the amount of even numbers is
the same as the amount of whole natural numbers the
same you heard me right so your intuition might tell
you well there should be half as many right because
in the natural numbers what are the natural numbers made
out of just these even ones and the odd ones
so if we just take the even ones how can
that be the same size as the natural numbers because
you're leaving out all the odd ones it makes no
sense and yet Cantor was able to prove that this
is the case kind of weird but it gets weirder
because when we take the rational numbers what Cantor was
able to prove is that there are just as many
rational numbers as there are even numbers and natural whole
numbers so now in rational numbers this is even weirder
of a result because you can see that there are
supposedly an infinite number of rational numbers just between 0
and 1 how can that be the case how could
how can this result be the way that it is
it makes no sense and yet you prove that this
is the case and the last example is the real
numbers and this was the most shocking and scandalous example
of all because here you might think well then the
real numbers must be the same size infinity as all
the others and that means there's just one size of
infinity but what Cantor approved was that actually there are
infinitely more real numbers just between 0 & 1 then
there are all the natural numbers and all the rational
numbers and what he discovered there is that there is
different sizes of infinity and this is what he proved
and this is what shook the world of mathematics nobody
ever thought about infinity in this way before and certainly
nobody actually ever proved it in a rigorous fashion so
then you can see where this is going not only
to canter discover that there are two sides of infinity
but he was able to prove that there are three
sizes four sizes five sizes and so on you guessed
it to infinity so there are infinite sizes of infinity
and he was able to demonstrate this and to show
how you can create all these different sizes of infinity
pretty amazing stuff he spent over 20 years of his
life every single day studying the logic of set theory
and specifically of infinite sets and these were the results
that he got and then of course all these results
have been verified and have become established standard mathematics that
you can learn these days and universities it's pretty advanced
type of mathematics so they don't teach it to you
in high school so many people never learned about this
stuff but never left this is the case very very
counterintuitive he had to come up with some ingenious reasoning
and arguments for how to prove this stuff one of
the ways he did it is he came up with
this famous diagonalization argument which I can't go into here
it's quite technical and I don't want to bog this
this lecture down with with a bunch of complicated math
but basically what it involves is of putting one set
in one-to-one correspondence with other set so what he says
is that if you can take one infinite set and
then match each element to another set that's also infinite
then those two sets have to have the same number
of infinity but if you can show that you actually
cannot match up every element in this infinite set with
every element in this infinite set the GNAT shows you
that they're actually different sizes of infinity and that there's
infinitely many but it gets even weirder because Cantor was
a devout Orthodox Christian and he took his religion very
seriously and what he discovered to himself is that not
only was he just studying mathematics and logic here but
he actually believed very firmly that he was penetrating the
mind of God as he was understanding these infinities and
he called the infinity of all infinities the absolute infinite
capital a capital I absolute infinite and he referred to
that as God he actually thought that he discovered the
essence of God because to him as a mathematician you
can see how it makes sense mathematicians usually see themselves
as studying the very fundamental aspects of reality and so
he thought that all of reality is made up of
number and of logic and of infinity and then the
infinity of all infinities well that's God one of the
reasons he thought this is because see he discovered that
infinity has a very paradoxical property when you take one
infinite set like the natural whole numbers and then you
take a subset of it like the even numbers or
the odd numbers that's a subset right so you would
think that's actually only half of the whole but when
he was able to prove is that actually the subset
of an infinite set can be identical in size to
the whole and this was a remarkable and scandalous result
but you can also see the interesting interconnections this has
metaphysically with God because what this means that if God
is infinity then every piece of God is also an
infinity which is in a sense equivalent to the whole
so it's like God is being holographically projected into every
subset and what that makes infinity capable of is that
infinity is sort of pregnant with possibility in that infinity
can spawn off smaller infinities which still contain the whole
infinity within themselves you see so it's a it's a
very very interesting result in fact Cantor wrote to one
of his colleagues Richard Dedekind who was also a famous
mathematician he was one of the only colleagues who supported
Cantor after he proved this result to himself he immediately
wanted to Mail off the proof to Richard Dedekind to
have him double-check but canter already knew his proof was
airtight and so to detta Kent he wrote I see
it but I can't believe it she couldn't believe the
result that he was looking at because he proved to
himself this this completely counterintuitive paradigm shattering feature of mathematics
which nobody up to those days was able to show
and this was in the early 20th century mathematics has
a very long and rich history so by that point
many mathematicians thought that they fully understood mathematics which is
a an interesting lesson to those people who think that
all well math and science understands everything no not even
close just a hundred years ago we made these massive
discoveries within the fields of mathematics and within quantum mechanics
and physics and cosmology so well we're still on the
cutting edge here but see contra had a problem in
that he was viciously demonized by all his colleagues in
academia as a hoax as a kook as some crazy
radical who was just trying to destroy the field of
mathematics that's how most of the mathematical establishment reacted against
Cantor's proofs they didn't take him on his merit and
this really disturbed and bothered Cantor because he invested his
entire lifetime into this and not only that but he
wasn't just doing math in his mind to him he
was traversing the mind of God and the thing that
disturbed him the most was when he tried to show
his proofs and his his discoveries of God to his
Orthodox Christian contemporaries they denounced him as a pantheist and
they refused to have anything to do with him and
this was basically the equivalent of being outcast as a
pariah from your Christian community being rejected and being called
a heretic that's in essence what happened to him they
didn't punish him but they ostracized him and to him
this was deeply disturbing and it sent him into a
deep depression and caused him a lot of mental anguish
and ultimately he ended up spending his final days in
an insane insane asylum and that's where he died because
he was having mental breakdowns now this is a interesting
because there are a couple of ways we can think
about this one reason he was having his mental breakdowns
is just because of the social ostracism that he received
but I think it he even goes deeper I think
that one of the reasons he ended up in this
insane asylum is because he was actually tapping into the
mind of God into absolute infinity I'm not sure whether
he actually had direct consciousness or enlightenment experiences maybe he
did if he did I can understand why he might
then lose his mental stability well it's because when you
are having enlightenment glimpses but your entire culture around you
is telling you that all that is wrong and also
again goes against your fundamental faith in Orthodox Christianity which
denounces pantheism then then you can see how this creates
a giant kind of rift in your mind and then
you're not sure how to cope with this do I
stay loyal to my faith and to orthodoxy or do
I accept what my proofs and what my reasoning and
what my direct insights are showing me which is that
everything is unified everything is infinite and therefore pantheism is
true you see the problem with Orthodox Christianity is that
they deny pantheism whereas in fact Jesus was of course
a pantheist he was enlightened enlightenment is pantheism that's what
it is but of course to to an orthodox mind
to a traditionalist mind it makes no sense and it's
very threatening that idea because they see God is some
figure sitting up in the clouds who created the world
in seven days and all this other kind of silly
nonsense they don't recognize those it's just metaphors trying to
point to absolute infinity which is by its nature formless
and so how are you gonna understand the formless especially
in a mainstream context you can't talk about absolute infinity
in a Bible well one of the reasons is because
when the Bible was written they didn't even have these
notions of infinity or the absolute you know these things
are mostly the byproducts of centuries of human cultural development
so it took a while for that stuff to to
be accessible to people even these days even today in
the 21st century is I'm talking about absolute infinity most
people have no idea what I'm talking about and it
goes completely over their head think about 2,000 years ago
how that would have gone over with people it wouldn't
have worked 2,000 years ago what you needed in order
to spread this idea of God and absolute infinity is
you needed Bible stories that's what worked well back then
by and large so I think that Cantor lost his
mental stability because either he did have direct enlightenment experiences
and he couldn't fully integrate and make sense of them
really what he should have done is like God to
his end monastery but I bet you he didn't know
what a Zen monastery is back then or there's other
possibility which is that Cantor was a brilliant logician and
mathematician and he was really good at symbolizing and conceptualizing
absolute infinity but he never actually got far enough to
have a direct experience of it he didn't actually have
an Enlightenment experience and in that case I can see
even moreso how he would end up with a mental
breakdown because what he did is he spent 20 years
of his life trying to conceptualize God and he basically
got lost in his own mind and let that be
a lesson to those of you who try to conceptualize
absolute infinity I know some of you are out there
like me I'm a very big conceptualize er I love
to conceptualize this kind of stuff but you also have
to see the limits and know when to stop and
when to shut your mind off and went to go
beyond your mind see your mind can conceptualize absolu infinities
some degree but you have to recognize that it's not
it and if you're going to spend the rest of
your life trying to get to absolute infinity through conceptualization
through using your mind through reasoning and through logic be
careful about that because you actually might go insane I
think there's a really good reason why famous mathematicians I
know multiple of them certain physicists of course we know
famous authors throughout history why they become depressed depressive suicidal
or end up in a sane asylums it's a it's
a interesting and rather common phenomenon and I think the
reason that is because they get lost in the depths
and bowels of their own mind you just conceptualize so
much and so much and so much and you don't
know any other alternatives nobody tells you about meditation nobody
tells you about self inquiry that you just keep conceptualizing
and then you keep going down the rabbit hole down
the rabbit hole and then you actually lose your mind
that's what will happen to you of course it will
because you're trying to grasp the absolute infinite with this
little tiny brain that you have it's not going to
work trying to do it is almost the definition of
insanity now let me read you some quotes from Cantor
because he has some beautiful ways of describing his discoveries
he said quote the actual infinite arises in three contexts
first when it is realized in the most complete form
in a fully independent otherworldly being god where I call
it the absolute infinite and he spells absolute infinite with
capital letters secondly when it occurs in the contingent created
world the world around us and thirdly when the mind
grasps it in the abstract as a mathematical magnitude number
or type and quote so you see he talks about
three different levels of accessing infinity the first one is
actually enlightenment or direct access and just the fact that
he was open to this possibility shows me that maybe
he has some glimpses or maybe he just knew that
it was possible but he didn't actually realize it himself
secondly as you see infinity all around us everything you
see around you is infinite these are like the minor
infinities within the absolute infinity you see absolute infinity contains
an infinite number of smaller infinities within it which are
also reflecting the nature of the absolute within themselves like
an ever expanding infinite fractal in infinite dimensions and infinite
colors and an infinite possible ways and thirdly he says
that you can just grasp it with your mind in
the abstract so in a mathematical sense you can grab
it as a formula approve that's actually the weakest way
you see the most important way is to access it
directly as God to encounter God for yourself he also
says this quote the fear of infinity is a form
of myopia that destroys the possibility of seeing the actual
infinite even though it in its highest form has created
and sustains us and in its secondary transfinite forms occurs
all around us and even inhabits our minds end quote
so you see Cantor wasn't just talking about a potential
theoretical mathematical possibility of infinity he's talking about that everything
you see around you is infinite and it's an infinity
within an infinity within an infinity with an infinity that's
the most mind-blowing part of this and lastly he says
quote I am so in favor of the actual infinite
that instead of admitting that nature opposed it as is
commonly said I hold that nature makes frequent use of
it everywhere in order to show more effectively the perfections
of its author author spell to the capital a he's
talking about God there I believe that there is no
part of matter which is not actually divisible and consequently
the least particle ought to be considered as a full
world of infinity of different creatures end quote so think
about what he's saying here he's saying that everything is
infinitely divisible and every division is itself an infinity so
you can zoom in into reality as much as you
want and you're going to find whole universes and worlds
and infinite numbers of creatures and things happening within that's
pretty revolutionary to think that way so you can see
how he got ostracized for it but he he stuck
to his guns he didn't really give in to the
mainstream he wanted to suffer a mental breakdown instead of
giving in to the mainstream and what's amazing is that
he died in ill repute and then it took a
few more decades before mainstream mathematics and science really caught
on to his discoveries and nowadays everything he discovered it's
just considered mainstream math so you see this just shows
you how powerful paradigms are and how dangerous paradigm block
is and that to make a radical discovery in mathematics
or in science is not an easy thing at all
sure you could make the discovery but then when you
try to convince mainstream culture or your colleagues or academia
or the scientific community of your discoveries well um you
might be shocked to us to discover that they will
not accept it because they're stuck in their paradigm and
they are not going to give it up easily so
with Cantor I think that he almost grasped absolute infinity
but I think that he was really on the edge
there he wasn't able to have a really deep full-on
enlightened experience because if he did then he wouldn't have
had any kind of mental break if he fully accepted
integrated he would have become a mystic and a sage
and he would have went on to teach and he
would have been happy he would have been ecstatic he
would have been living in the in the presence of
God all the time but unfortunately he just didn't make
it that far he's a little bit too far ahead
of his time so speaking actually of that the perfect
segue is moving on to our next historical figure geared
on Oh Bruno whose dates are 1550 to 1600 ad
so he was also a figure very much ahead of
his time you might be familiar with the name Bruno
not from the movie not from the Borat guy but
from your history class he was a famous heretic who
was burned at the stake by the Roman Inquisition for
his views about reality and the universe what's interesting though
that he wasn't just a scientist he was a Dominican
monk turned mystic and he was a devoutly Christian except
of course when you actually realize what Christianity is pointing
you to all your Christian friends especially back in the
1600s will condemn you as a devil because again you're
going to be talking about pantheism you're going to be
seeing God everywhere and that just does not rub the
Orthodox Church in the right way so he was a
monk and then he discovered the works of Copernicus and
Galileo this was the time of the Scientific Revolution and
the Copernican revolution and he was just so moved by
by these discoveries being made by Copernicus and the discovery
there was simply that it's really more of an insight
or a paradigm shift than a discovery is the idea
that the earth is not at the center of the
universe but actually is orbiting around and of course Copernicus
and Galileo were also called heretics and they were also
rejected by the establishment their lives were also endangered but
Bruno because he was a mystic he took it one
step further one step beyond the pale for the church
he wrote a book called army infinite universe and worlds
and then he went around all Europe promoting his radical
ideas which he talks about in the book let me
read you some quotes this is a remarkable stuff quote
there is a single general space a single vast immensity
which we may freely call void void with the capital
V in it are innumerable globes like this on which
we live and grow this space we declare to be
infinite since neither reason convenience possibility nor sense perception nor
nature assigned to it a limit in it our many
worlds of the same kind as our own he also
says quote innumerable suns exist in numerable Earth's revolve around
these Suns in a manner similar to the way the
seven planets revolve around our Sun and living beings inhabit
these worlds encode now keep in mind this is the
1600s the 1600s he says this this is before we
have even like telescopes before we have any satellites before
we travel to the moon we don't even have science
fiction novels back then and he's already talking about a
millions of stars with planets around them with living beings
living on them think about how ridiculously a visionary he
was and then he says quote the one infinite and
those with capital letters is perfect simply and of itself
nothing can be greater or better than it this is
the one hole everywhere god universal nature not but the
infinite can be a perfect image and reflection thereof for
the finite is imperfect every sensible world is imperfect whereas
evil and good matter inform light and darkness sadness and
joy unite and all things are everywhere in change in
motion but all things come in infinity to the order
of unity truth and goodness and quote so clearly he
realized that we are living in an absolute infinity and
he saw the full ramifications of that he saw the
relativity of it he was able to connect the dots
and to apply the relativity and to to convince himself
that hey Planet Earth human beings were just one tiny
speck of this entire creation there's nothing really special about
us and for this he was eventually arrested he was
tried over a period of 10 years and ultimately hung
upside down tortured and burned at the stake in 1600
by the Roman Inquisition for heresy and for pantheism and
for advancing his idea of multiple worlds and multiple universes
pretty remarkable stuff see this is what happens when you
are ahead of your time in your thinking this is
what happens when you challenge paradigms it's not taken lightly
and it's still not taken lightly today you might think
well that was close to the Middle Ages that was
500 years ago or whatever and they're you know we've
we've outgrown those barbaric times really have we have we
really look at what's going on in our culture we
can't even get facts straight about presidential candidates and yet
you're saying that there's no problems with paradigm locks in
our society there are huge problems it's as big a
problem that's ever been it's just that we're we're a
little bit more civil about it these days we usually
don't burn people at the stake although you know in
some countries they might stone to death for this sort
of stuff so keep that in mind when you're learning
radical stuff when you're trying to go deep into reality
to understand some facet of reality you understand that you're
leaving the comfortable herd mentality that you've been in for
your entire life don't expect social support don't expect double-blind
experiments don't expect scientific backing if you want that stuff
you're scared you're sitting in the herd that means you
got to be part of the herd and what we're
talking about with deep self-actualization as we're talking about going
off-roading into uncharted territories and there might be dragons there
there might be aliens there might be all sorts of
weird stuff you just don't know what you'll find that's
why raggle open-mindedness is such an important principle to obey
and understanding epistemology and paradigm blocks and false skepticism default
positions all this stuff that I keep harping on you
can see why it's so important because otherwise you're going
to commit the same mistakes that mankind has been committing
for thousands of years and still convinced today many smart
scientists authors and mathematicians still commit all these mistakes today
in fact I I have I had a written correspondence
with a with a really good mathematician in a university
and I was trying to communicate with him about absolute
infinity and he was just not open to it even
though he understands what absolute infinity is mathematically but he's
not open to the possibility of having a direct experience
of absolute infinity for himself and realizing that that's what
God is he's not open to that because he's he's
stuck in his mathematical paradigm which says that that's not
possible see now let's go a little bit further back
in time to the ancient Greeks and Romans because actually
the ancient Greeks and Romans were a lot wiser than
many of the Christians that followed afterwards because largely they
weren't as crippled by dogma and paradigm lock so firstly
we've got Aristotle whose dates are 384 to 322 BC
here's what he says if coming to be and passing
away do not give out it is only because that
from which things come to be is infinite and he
says quote the limited always finds its limit in something
so that there must be no limit if everything is
always limited by something different from itself end quote so
Aristotle clearly understood some of the ramifications of infinity and
this idea that things always need another limit to limit
them and so because of this we must have an
ever-expanding chain of limits which amounts to infinity we also
have an even later figure anaxagoras whose dates are 510
to 428 BC he understood this idea as well he
said quote there is no smallest among the small and
no largest amount of large but always something still smaller
and something still larger end quote pretty remarkable this was
500 years before Christ this was even before the Buddha
and we have then an even earlier figure Anaximander whose
dates are 610 to 546 BC this is like the
edge of written human history right here and I want
to read you some of Anaximander x' ideas about the
origins of creation I'm going to quote you from Wikipedia
because they summarized this quite nicely he had two ideas
or two labels that he gave to the source of
creation he called it the RK and he also called
it the apron so first let's cover the RK RK
is the same root as in the word archaic but
it doesn't mean old it means something else so here's
what it means with the PDS as quote RK is
a Greek word meaning beginning origin or the source of
action or the first principle or element and this was
a term first used by Anaximander the first principle or
element corresponds to the ultimate underlying substance and the ultimate
undemonstrative principle RK designates the source origin or root of
things that exist Aristotle foreground with the meaning of RK
as the element or principle of a thing which although
undemonstrative and Intel intangible in itself provides the conditions of
the possibility of that Singh being from this all things
first come to be and into this they are resolved
in a final state this source of entity is always
preserved the Greek philosophers ascribed to the RK divine attributes
it is the divine horizon of substance that encompasses and
values all things the RK is technically what underlies all
of reality and appearance and quote that's from Wikipedia so
that's the idea of the RK and then we have
the Greek idea of the AP Ron spelled AP e
irom apron it's kind of weird to pronounce and Anaximander
also used this term here's what wikipedia says a Perron
is a Greek word meaning that which is unlimited boundless
infinite indefinite Anaximander believed the beginning or ultimate reality is
eternal and infinite or boundless subject to neither old age
nor decay which perpetually yields fresh material from which everything
can be perceived and derived a piranha is generating the
opposites like hot cold wet dry etc which acted on
the creation of the world everything is generated generated from
apron and then it is destroyed by going back into
apron according to necessity he believed that infinite worlds are
generated from apron and then they are destroyed there again
Greek philosophy entered a high level abstraction it adapted or
it adopted apron as the origin of all things because
it is completely indefinite and quote rather remarkable isn't it
how the descriptions of a guy who was writing and
thinking over two and a half thousand years ago are
completely in accordance what we what we talked about in
part 1 of this series his descriptions are identical what
he's describing here is non duality a Greek from two
and a half thousand years ago that's amazing and also
he talks about infinite worlds a Greek from two and
a half thousand years ago was able to foresee that
there are infinite worlds in our reality how amazing is
that but it doesn't end there we also have Heraclitus
Heraclitus is also quite an old Greek figure his dates
are 535 to 475 BC and this dude was enlightened
he was clearly enlightened he writes like a Zen master
in short little cryptic esoteric phrases let me read you
some of them you have to really read between the
lines with Heraclitus because he doesn't go out of his
way to spell everything out for you he says quote
one does wisely in agreeing that all things are in
fact one thing and quote also quote one thing the
only wise thing is both unwilling and willing to be
called the names Zeus and quote you see how clever
that is you see what he's talking about it's both
willing and unwilling to be called Zeus so this is
the whole Zen problem of pointing anytime you call something
God it's not God so should we call it God
or not called God if you call it God you
do it a disservice and you're lying if you don't
call it God you're also ignoring the fact that everything
is God because God is both in everything but not
anything he also says quote one would never discover the
limits of soul should one traverse every road so deep
a measure does it possess end quote and now of
course his use the Greek word use of the word
soul is actually spirit more like spirit or more like
mind and what we're talking about here is infinite mind
the mind of God if you will if you think
of all of reality as occurring within the mind of
God all of this right here look around you this
is all occurring within the mind of God this is
spirit spirit is not somewhere else the mind of God
is not somewhere else it's all right here you might
wonder below if mine has if God has a mind
is that like located in God's brain then where's god's
brain where's god's body no no you're not understanding the
significance of what's being said here would we say that
all of reality is occurring within the mind of God
the mind of God is here it's manifest it doesn't
occur in a brain somewhere God doesn't have a body
somewhere else there is nowhere else it's all right here
imagine that God's brain and God's mind and God's body
is identical it's all the same stuff and what is
that stuff it's nothing and it's all right here what
we're really talking about here is we're talking about idealism
versus realism and people who are stuck in the realist
paradigm which is pretty much everybody on earth they have
a really hard time understanding idealism because the way they
try to understand idealism is by taking idealism and then
couching it within their realist paradigm and then when they
do that it doesn't make any sense to them so
when I say the mind of God a realist will
think okay the mind of God needs to be in
a brain or it needs to be grounded in some
kind of substance like atoms no that's not what's being
said idealism means that you have the mind of God
and nothing else there's nothing there at all it's not
grounded in anything it doesn't need a brain it's a
mechanical it's not physical it's consciousness it's pure consciousness it's
like a dream where is the dream occurring not in
a head somewhere not in a brain it's occurring nowhere
in nothingness that's what idealism means now if you don't
like that idea well that's something you have to get
over if that doesn't make sense to you you need
to have direct experience of it that will fix your
problem but what you can't do is you can't then
say okay well let's try to make sense of idealism
using all our scientific paradigms no no no what we're
trying to do here is reject all the scientific paradigms
not in the sense that science is wrong and science
is bad there's nothing wrong with science science is useful
when it's you used in its limited domain science is
used to understand and manipulate the relative world science is
not used to ascertain absolute infinity it can't be because
science is limited that's what makes science science that's what
makes science differ from religion see the only way you
can arrive at absolute infinity is through an infinite method
science is not an infinite method science as a limited
method every method in fact is a limited method so
how do you arrive at the absolute through no method
at all and now you can see why Zen people
speak in riddles and why a lot of times people
get upset because when people talk like this is like
well what are you talking about us all is just
nonsense it's not nonsense it's just that you're trying to
grasp it with your rational mind and we keep telling
you that you can't do that because what we're talking
about is infinite and your rational mind is finite you
see you have to be able to to make a
leap here a leap of consciousness is required you can't
access absolute infinity with your current limited state of consciousness
what work Heraclitus also says quote in the case of
the circles circumference beginning and end are common end quote
and I hope you can read between the lines there
and see that he's not talking about geometry he's not
talking about circles he's using a metaphor there to talk
about the very fundamental structure of all of existence the
beginning and the end are the same there is no
beginning and end really just like in a circle and
he says also quote they do not understand how while
differing from it is an agreement with itself there is
a back turning connection like that of a bow or
a liar end quote and of course he's not talking
about bows and liars here what is he saying he's
trying to explain the paradoxical nature of absolute infinity namely
that it both is and is not simultaneously and that
the duality of existence and non-existence has to come together
and connect the way that they do in a bow
or a liar or if you have two sides of
the same coin the two sides the heads and the
tails they have to be connected into a unity they
can't be separate from each other see which produces this
whole paradoxical nature - it is heads different from tails
in a sense it is but is heads identical details
also in a sense it is because heads is not
separate from tails they're connected together and lastly he says
God is day and night winter and summer war and
peace satiety and famine and undergoes change in a way
that fire when it is mixed with spices gets called
by the name that accords with the bouquet of each
spice end quote and I love this metaphor here because
this explains why it's so difficult to isolate God it's
sort of like you're taking some spices and you put
them into a fire and then you're getting a different
aroma well when you get that aroma you call it
different names cumin pepper coriander cinnamon whatever it might be
but you don't see the unity of all those things
you don't really get the essence of the fire there
because or the smoke because it's just the smell and
the smell is what you focus on and you give
it different names well it's the same way with God
God the indefinite the formless has no form so it's
very difficult for our human minds to grasp it we
don't see it easily because the things we focus on
and see tend to be material gross things like colors
smells sights sounds so this explains how God could be
everywhere it's right there it's right here it's right here
it's not somewhere else God is right here but you're
not conscious of it because your mind is focused on
ordinary colors sounds Bob Jex people problems in your life
emotions you're so controlled and manipulated by all that like
like a marionette like a puppet on strings that you're
not able to discern the very subtle quality of nothingness
which is permeating all of somethingness you see and then
we also have Pythagoras from the famous Pythagorean formula so
Pythagoras his dates are 7 572 495 BC he was
also quite a an ancient Greek and here's what they
say about the pythagoreans he wasn't just a mathematician the
pythagorean's called the first thing that came into existence the
monad which begat the dyad which begat the numbers which
begat the point lines and finiteness it meant divinity the
first being or the totality of all beings that's the
monad that's their word for absolute infinity so Pythagoras was
a brilliant mathematician sort of like Cantor but also spirituality
was not lost on him and in fact the Pythagorean
school was this odd mixture of mathematics but also occultism
esotericism and spirituality all mixed together because they thought that
by discovering mathematics and learning various mathematical formulas and relationships
and geometry that they were actually coming into contact with
the essence of how the whole universe is created and
structured and of course that is God that is spirituality
so they married the two a rather interesting approach which
is very countered the way that we do math and
science these days and university settings where we divorce all
these all our scientific and mathematical discoveries from any sense
of spirituality or significance we don't see them from a
holistic perspective we just do math and science - to
write research papers to advance our careers to get Nobel
Prizes to write books to become celebrity scientists to make
famous inventions to market those inventions to sell technology to
earn money and to make a living that's how we
use math and science these days completely disconnected from the
essence of being and all of reality and spirituality we
don't let our discoveries actually transform our humanity we become
slaves to our discoveries and we do it in a
very unconscious and mechanical sort of way where our most
brilliant scientists and mathematicians will reject everything I'm saying here
in these two episodes about absolute infinity they might watch
all this and they'll just reject it I'll just say
it's just philosophy it's just that a physic is just
theory they won't be able to read between the lines
and to see that they need to go and experience
this absolute infinity for themselves and the the last Greek
that I want to read to you from Greek and
Roman actually is a plot nassif igure he was after
the time of Christ so his dates are 204 -
to 70 AD and because he came later we have
a lot of his works still surviving most those other
guys we don't have a lot of their works we
just have fragments but with platanus we have entire books
from him and this dude was enlightened it was one
light because he talks endlessly on and on about the
one and how to discern the one and all the
properties of the one what the one is and what
the one isn't in a very elegant sort of way
let me read you a little bit from platanus the
one he spells it with capital T and capital o
the one is all things and not a single one
of them it is because there is nothing in it
that all things come from in order that being may
exist the one is not being but the generation of
being so that no other form is left outside it
the one must be without form the one must be
understood as infinite not because it's size and number cannot
be measured or counted but because its power cannot be
comprehended for when you think of him as intellect or
God he is more and when you unify him in
your thought here also the degree of unity by which
he transcends your thought is more than you imagined it
to be and quote I love that description so he's
talking about the futility of trying to conceptualize God because
as soon as you have an idea of God God
is greater than that and if you increase your idea
to that a little bit more God is still greater
than that and more and still greater than that and
so no matter how big of an idea you can
imagine it's still too small for God because that's the
nature of infinity its ever-growing it's always bigger you can't
capture it in your mind he also says quote how
then does multiplicity come from one well because it is
everywhere for there is no where it is not now
if it itself were only everywhere it would itself be
all things but since it is also nowhere all things
come into being through him because he is everywhere but
are other than him because he is nowhere and quote
you see he's also talking like a Zen master in
these sort of paradoxical riddles where he is both affirming
and then negating everything he is saying because the nature
of infinity is that it is and it isn't at
the same time it doesn't fit our human categories or
simple dichotomies it is source of our categories and our
dichotomies that's why I can't fit into them it actually
makes perfect sense but only if you accept the idea
that you can't rationalize or conceptualize everything you encounter you
have to admit that there are limits to conceptualization and
a lot of people these days even very smart ones
don't like to admit these limits and lastly platanus says
of the one of absolute infinity he says it is
a beauty which makes beauty and quote I love how
he says that that's the law poetic quote for you
to end that off now I still have more than
I want to share with you so don't go anywhere
but we're going to take a quick intermission here because
I'm reading a lot of quotes to you in this
episode and it's quite straining on my voice so I'm
going to go take a short break and grab a
drink of water you don't go anywhere because I'll be
back here in a second in your time and then
we'll continue with some even more juicy historical examples ok
I'm back let's continue where we left off so we've
finished up with the Greeks and Romans and now I
want to move on to the Chi ba lien which
is an interesting book that was written pretty recently in
1908 but it claimed it was written by an anonymous
source but it claims that these teachings in the book
are hermetic teachings that go back to ancient Greece and
all the way to ancient Egypt over 2,000 years ago
so the Chi ba lien has some beautiful descriptions of
what they call the all and all is spelled a
ll capitalized all of it capitalized and that of course
refers to the one and only absolute infinity so here's
what the Chi ba lien says about it quote the
all must be infinite for there is nothing else to
define confine bound limit or restrict the all-in must be
infinite in time and eternal it must have always continuously
existed for there is nothing else to have ever created
it it must be infinite in space because it must
be everywhere for there is no place outside the all
it cannot be otherwise than continuous in space without break
cessation separation or interruption for there is nothing to break
separate or interrupt its continuity and nothing with which to
fill the gaps it must be infinite in power or
absolute for there is nothing to limit restrict restrain confine
disturb or condition it it is subject to no other
power for there is no other power and quote and
it also says quote do not make the mistake of
supposing that the little world you see around you the
earth which is just a mere grain of dust in
the universe don't make the mistake that this is the
universe itself there are millions upon millions of such worlds
and even greater and there are millions of millions of
such universes in existence within the infinite mind of the
all and quote and this was in 1908 so not
that long ago but still signs did not recognize that
there were planets around other stars systems that wasn't proven
until just recently and yet here we are anticipating this
100 years ago and in the hermetic teachings go quite
a long ways back thousands of years it also says
quote V all in the earth worm is yet the
earthworm sorry the all is in the earthworm and yet
the earthworm is far from being the all and still
the wonder remains that though the earthworm exists merely as
a lowly thing created and having its being solely within
the mind of the all yet the all is imminent
in the earthworm and in the particles that go to
make it up and quote you see so the describing
how every object you see around you is a minor
infinity within the larger absolute infinity it also says quote
nothing but the all can escape law and that is
because the all is law itself from which all laws
emerge and quote that's the cabal ian and then another
source that I'll cite to you is the law of
one which is a collection of books which are channeled
works and there's a lot of controversial stuff in these
books they're only about 40 years old so not very
old but I particularly love their descriptions of absolute infinity
or the Creator so I want to quote to you
from that it says quote consider if you will that
the universe is infinite this has yet to be proven
or disproven but we can assure you that there is
no end to yourselves your understanding what you could call
or what you would call your journey of seeking or
your perceptions of the creation that which is infinite cannot
be many for many myths is a finite concept to
have infinity you must identify or define the infinity as
a unity otherwise the term does not have any reference
or meaning in an infinite creator there can only be
unity and it goes on to say quote how did
intelligent infinity become individualized from itself in intelligent infinity discerned
a concept this concept was Finity this was the first
and primal paradox or distortion of the law of one
thus the one intelligent infinity invested itself in an exploration
of many news and due to infinite possibilities of intelligent
infinity there is no ending there's no ending to the
men enos their exploration 'this is free to continue infinitely
in to the eternal present and quote so you see
this is describing why we have all the dualistic stuff
that we have what's really going on is if you
imagine all of reality as an infinite singularity the way
that we've described it imagine that what reality is up
to is exploring itself becoming conscious of all its possible
forms and shapes out to infinity there's no end to
it so this process doesn't end so imagine this giant
sphere so to speak and there's like this ripple wave
of consciousness moving through the sphere and exploring everything within
the sphere forever sort of like a a video on
a loop that just watches itself except since the video
is of infinite length and of infinite content and can
be in infinite possible ways and in two dimensions this
video is just constantly playing itself out and it never
really even has to loop because there's always more new
stuff to explore to infinity this one infinite video contains
inside of it more videos and each of those contain
infinite more videos in each of those contain infinite more
videos to infinity forever and that's what reality is up
to is this self exploration process that's what you're doing
in life that's what I'm doing in my life that's
what every human being is ultimately doing is we're exploring
but we are not separate from this our perspectives are
all contributing to the greater whole to the all in
a sense that if you were a tiny video within
the larger video that would be one perspective that would
be like your life and then the other video would
be like my life but then they're making up the
much larger perspective and there's an infinity of all these
different videos so that was the law of one now
also what's interesting is to look into Kabbalah Kabalah is
the esoteric and occult domain of Judaism and in Kabbalah
they have this notion called the Alf and the ALF
is simply their representation of the letter a so we
have the alphabet right well a alpha alpha but also
the Alf isn't just the letter A in Hebrew it
also means the number one or unity and so of
course the Hebrew alphabet and also their number system plays
an important sort of spiritual significance in Kabbalah because Kabbalah
is all about numerology and breaking words apart and finding
all sorts of esoteric connections between words so I'm not
too familiar with exactly how all that works it's a
deep art and science you can go study it but
the important thing to know here is about the elf
because this will be important the next thing that I
quote you so here's what they say about the Alf
the Alf is quote the primordial one which contains all
numbers or they say quote it's a point in space
that contains all other points anyone who gazes into it
can see and it can see everything in the universe
from every angle simultaneously without distortion overlap or confusion it's
to see the infinite universe in a single glance so
going back to my analogy from part one of this
series I talked about the zip file that's what they
call this thing they called the elf that's my zip
file same thing so that's from Kabbalah and the reason
I talk about the Alf and I talked about Kabbalah
is because I want to end this episode with a
long excerpt from a short story by jorge luis borges
he wrote this short story called the ALF in 1945
and Borges was an interesting writer because he wrote short
stories very short just a few pages long each but
all his stories were about the sort of paradoxical puzzling
aspects of reality he was sort of the equivalent of
emcee Esher but when it came to writing and not
art or painting so this sort story called the Alf
is a the perfect capstone to everything we've talked about
when it comes to absolute infinity it gives you an
idea of what it feels like to experience absolute infinity
for yourself now let me set up the story for
you basically there's the narrator and then the narrator has
a friend now the friend claims that he has discovered
the Alf as an actual object which exists in his
basement and so the narrator is very interested and he
he sort of in competition with his friend but he
goes to his friends basement to check out this suppose
it elf and he doesn't know what it's going to
be or he doesn't really even believe that it's anything
but he just goes along to see what's there and
now I'm going to quote to you from the short
story of what he actually experiences here's what he says
quote all language is a set of symbols whose use
amongst its speakers assumes a shared past how then can
I translate into words the limitless elf which my floundering
mind can scarcely encompass even partial enumeration of infinity is
irresolvable in that unbounded moment I saw millions of delightful
and horrible acts but none amazed me so much as
the fact that all occupy the same point without superposition
and without transparency what my eyes saw was simultaneous what
I shall write is successive because language is successive something
of it though I will capture under the step towards
the right I saw a small iridescent sphere of almost
unbearable brightness at first I thought it was spinning but
then I realized the movement was an illusion produced by
the dizzying spectacles inside the Alf was probably two or
three centimetres in diameter but Universal space was contained inside
it with no diminution in size each thing was infinite
things because I could clearly see it from every point
in the cosmos I saw the populace see I saw
a dawn and dusk I saw the multitudes of the
Americas I saw a silvery spiderweb at the center of
a black pyramid I saw broken labyrinths salt endless eyes
saw all the mirrors on the planet and none of
them reflecting me saw clusters of grapes snow tobacco veins
of metal water vapor saw convex equatorial deserts and there
every grain of sand saw a woman whom I shall
never forget saw her violent hair saw her haughty body
saw cancer in her breast saw a circle of dry
soil within a sidewalk where there once had been a
tree saw every letter of every single page at once
sigh salt saw simultaneous night and day saw sunset that
seemed to reflect the color of a rose in Bengal
saw my bedroom with no one in it saw in
a study a globe of the world placed between two
mirrors that multiplied itself endlessly saw horses with wind-whipped Mane's
on a beach in the Caspian Sea at dawn saw
the delicate bones of a hand saw the survivors of
a battle sending postcards saw tarot card in a window
shot saw the oblique shadows of ferns on the floor
of a greenhouse saw Tigers Pistons - tides armies saw
all the ants on earth saw a Persian astrolabe saw
the circulation of my dark blood saw the coils and
springs of love and the alterations of death saw the
elf from we're at once saw the earth in the
Alf and Alf once more in the earth and the
earth in Alf saw my face and my viscera sly
your face and I felt dizzy and I wept because
my eyes have seen that secret hypothetical object whose name
has been usurped by men but which no man has
ever truly looked upon the inconceivable universe I had a
sense of infinite veneration and infinite pity and its friend
replies serves you right having your mind bottled for sticking
your nose in where you weren't wanted and you may
wrack your brains but you will never repay me for
this revelation not in a hundred years and code that
is the Alf that is absolute infinity that's what it
feels like to glimpse cough it's such an overwhelming experience
that stretches beyond all experience because it's really not an
experience it's prior to all experience that when I first
encountered absolute infinity actually not hypothetically but actually I still
have scars on my fingertips you can't see because the
camera zoomed in on my faith and not on my
fingertips they're very fine scars but what happened was that
I experienced a very powerful energetic release and this energetic
release was beyond anything you could imagine the human body
is capable of just like this this surge of emotions
and also I guess it was prana the Hindus talk
about pranic energy it was like prana that just shot
out through my body and out my fingertips and my
fingers the skin on all my fingers have started to
peel for about a couple of weeks after that experience
and then that healed back ah but then these sort
of micro scars these sort of visions in my fingerprints
they have still remained and my fingerprints have actually changed
and they're not the same as they used to be
so I know that sounds weird but I mean I
wouldn't believe it myself if it hadn't actually happened to
me I'm still kind of in shock about it but
it just goes to show you the power of this
insight this is not an insight where you just kind
of sit back on your chair and you're just kind
of mulling something over it's like oh yeah absolute infinity
it's like oh yeah I got it now oh yeah
that's cool that's really cool it's not like that it's
so powerful that actually it will it will change your
epigenetics I think that that's what happened with my with
my fingertips that actually like the the genes and my
body were changed the expression of the genes were changed
on some level after that revelation that's how powerful of
a revelation that was so there are some evidence for
you some anecdotal evidence for you of what happens or
what could happen when you experience absolute authority not to
say that that would happen to you per se it's
just what happened to me and everyone's experience of course
will be different now in this episode I covered a
lot of sources and it's quite amazing that there are
so many references to absolute infinity throughout history in spiritual
circles in religious circles in scientific circles and mathematical circles
it crosses the boundaries of all disciplines and notice here
that I've only talked about Western sources I did not
even try to go in and enumerate all the Eastern
sources like yogic sources Hindu sources Vedanta sources though punished
odds I mean there's so much there's Taoism there's Buddhism
is just there is a Schiavo Tantra there's there's Jainism
and this is just still scratching the tip of the
iceberg of all the Eastern sources say so there's a
there's a lot of material there to dig through if
you really care to we're just scratching the surface the
biggest takeaways from from all this is firstly I want
you to recognize that reality is deeply paradoxical and that
this is not a mistake this is how it must
be that's the very essence of what reality and existence
must be is that they must be a paradox because
the whole notion of trying to define something of making
distinctions this is all paradoxical because it's all relative and
the relative only exists because of the absolute and yet
the absolute is not separate from the relative they are
the same and yet still you can distinguish them in
your mind and you can access both the absolute separately
and then you can live in the relative world and
then you can come back into the absolute and then
also you can bring them together and merge them together
non duality is paradoxical in that it includes duality and
it's not separate from duality and in fact it's identical
to duality but the only way you can appreciate that
is by first encountering the non-dual in its raw and
pure form as absolute infinity then you can bring that
back into your ordinary relative world and then you can
see that oh yeah my relative world is not other
than that non dual absolute world they're actually the same
they actually depend upon each other another takeaway here is
that truth is beyond all human experience truth is not
something you know truth is not something you believe truth
is not a theory truth is not an idea truth
truth of the capital T not relative truth but absolute
truth is beyond language beyond logic beyond imagination beyond brain
beyond physics beyond even death and it's beyond experience it
transcends everything because it must because when we're talking about
truth with a capital T we're talking about the most
fundamental thing and turns out that it's nothing and also
everything as it must be in this very paradoxical way
but perhaps the most important takeaway here is that absolute
infinity can be grasped despite the fact that it's beyond
all these things it can actually be grasped by you
not intellectually not conceptually not philosophically but actually because it
is actual because it's right here it sustains everything because
it's not separate from you because there's no boundary between
you and it that's what creates the possibility of grasping
it but this grasping of it cannot be in the
way that you take your hand and you reach out
and you grasp a banana like the way a monkey
would grasp a banana not like that and not the
way that your mind can grasp some scientific theory not
like that either that's the same thing as a monkey
trying to grasp a banana the monkeys hand is separate
from the banana that is trying to grasp and that
works in the relative world but it doesn't work in
the absolute world in the absolute world the only way
to do it to get there and to see what's
there is to become it you must become it how
well there actually can't be a method because every method
is indirect every method is a sort of reaching out
to AB the banana with your hand which already implies
the separation between you your hand and the banana in
the absolute world we're talking about an absolute unity of
everything so there no longer is anything outside the absolute
with which you could grasp the absolute now that might
seem like that's a deal breaker and that it's impossible
it's not impossible you just have to shift your perspective
to such a degree that you realize that you are
the absolute you don't grasp the absolute the absolute is
what you are it's what you is but not something
you've recognized yet about yourself and of course what that
means is that you must remove all the limitations and
all the constraints that create your sense of self and
you so what is keeping you separate from the absolute
well there's two ways to answer that one is nothing
nothing's keeping you separate from the absolute the absolute is
right here you're just not seeing it but to what's
keeping you separate is the fact that you're attached to
all the things that you like about yourself to the
way that you are to your sense of self to
your ego now the word ego sounds like it's a
little part of you but actually it encompasses a lot
more than just some little egotistical part of you ego
means every limited way in which you really are including
your body brain mind all your ideas about reality science
religion logic life sex everything everything is including is included
all of that are a set of constraints and limits
which you're attached to and as long as you're attached
to that how can you become God you can't because
you think you're a limited human thing so the only
way you can become God is by relinquishing your sense
of self and of course what does that mean that
means physical death from your perspective you can't just detach
from your mental notions of self that's not enough because
you're still going to identified with yourself as a physical
human creature that's very limiting that's not enough to get
you to absolute infinity if you want to experience the
total unity of the entire shebang all of it at
once you have to die you can't survive that process
so the way that God that God hides himself from
you is simply by the fact that you think you
are you and that thinking and believing that you're you
and not God is the only thing that separates you
from God pretty cool pretty cool how the whole thing
works it's extremely elegant and beautiful in its design it's
you might say perfect the deception that you are playing
on yourself as God to be yourself is perfect because
see here's what God is doing God as the absolute
wanted to experience all of its own richness but how
can it do that it really can't unless it first
limits itself because in its absolute form it's everything so
there's nothing for it to discover there's nothing for it
to do it's just everything and nothing at the same
time so God in His infinite wisdom what it did
is it started to create limitations within itself because then
the limitations can explore other limitations interact with them and
then they can have this sort of sense of discovery
and this way God can marvel at its own structure
see you might think that absolute infinity doesn't meet that
because it already everything but the one thing absolute infinity
doesn't have is it doesn't have limitation you see because
when you're absolutely everything you're completely unlimited you might tell
me well that's great that's what how I'd want to
stay I'd always want to be unlimited well you'd get
bored of that after a while in a sense you'd
want to explore all the limitations within you and so
that's what God is busy doing and that's why God
created my perspective created your perspective and of course God
is not separate from us so we are God creating
these perspectives so it's sort of like in a sense
you know the movie men in black where they have
that sort of a memory flasher wiper gadget where they
hold it up in front of you it flashes and
it raised erases all the memories that you had about
a certain event that's sort of what God did to
himself it's sort of like God existed his everything and
then God said you know what let me try to
exist as not God but as a finite thing what
would it be like to not be God that's sort
of what God thought of course God doesn't really think
but that's sort of like what God thought if we
anthropomorphize God and so he said okay let me actually
try it and so he took a little memory flasher
thing he flashed it in his own eyes forgetting the
fact that he is God and that he created everything
and then he created a just like a perspective a
limited perspective of him as a human being or as
an ant or as a cat or whatever and now
we are all walking around as he's like limited zombified
versions of the absolute and then our whole job in
life is to play this game and to realize more
and more and more to become more more conscious of
the infinity of everything and just how amazing it is
and that's basically what life boils down to in a
nutshell and so your journey is from the limited to
the infinite and then back from the infinite to the
limited and this is all happening simultaneously so it's not
happening across time the way you might think because for
God it already happened it's only from our limited perspective
that it seems like there's time unfolding stuffs of all
things stuffs happening it's both true that stuff is evolving
but also that it's not evolving it depends on your
perspective from the relative perspective stuff is always evolving from
the absolute perspective of there's no such thing it's all
there simultaneously it's the ALF and of course these things
are not separate from themselves so that's absolute infinity for
you the question is do you desire it for yourself
do you desire to cognize it to directly experience it
because that's the only thing that makes a difference here
I'm not telling you all this stuff so that you
can believe me and then go out there preaching to
people writing comments such as oh yeah God is absolute
Finity that does no good at all because when you
say God is absolute infinity from a position of not
having experienced that yourself you're actually lying it's just a
fantasy for you it's not true at all for you
because you haven't experienced it you're just walking around and
you're serving as a vector for this mental virus of
absolute infinity that's what it is that's the only way
I can communicate to you is to infect you with
this mental virus this meme of absolute infinity your job
is to see that you have been infected and then
you've got two options you could either just be infected
and then run around infecting others the way that most
people do and wreck a lot of havoc and that's
a very dangerous thing you'll hurt a lot of people
including yourself doing that and the second way is recognized
ah I've been infected for a reason the reason I
was infected was so that I could go and actualize
this infection in myself and not so that I can
run around blabbermouth thing and infecting other people blindly see
the big difference and it's a it's one that gets
lost on a lot of people very easy to miss
this point so if you are serious about actual izing
this then my question is how much do you desire
it do you actually desire to know the truth that's
the most important thing you might say well Leo gives
me a technique and I'll just go do it no
that's not good enough this is not about a technique
or a formula this is about your desire you need
to purify your desire do you really want it why
do you want it are you going to prioritize it
over all your other in life because your life is
filled with ego distractions from business to making money to
having sex to raising kids to going to school to
getting good grades to to eating good food to going
to parties to doing everything under the Sun including reading
books about absolute infinity and about God you'll do absolutely
everything except actually experience absolute infinity because again like I
said this requires you surrendering your most precious thing which
is yourself the only way you can overcome that is
with a desire a high quality high consciousness desire for
the truth which trumps all other concerns that's what's necessary
how do you develop that truth it's an inner knowing
it's an inner wisdom wisdom is required on your part
I can't beat it into you you honestly have to
see that this is something that is your mission in
life to discover and if you can't see that then
you're hopeless and even if you can see it but
your desire is still weak and it's flagging and it's
easily diverted by distractions by television by porn by internet
by all the nonsense that goes on by arguing with
people by trying to prove other people wrong and all
this on and on and on if you're distracted by
all those then your desire is just too weak and
that's why you will never see absolute infinity but if
you can really purify your desire then all the doors
will magically start to open for you even if you
don't have the techniques right now even if you don't
know what the next step is as long as you've
got that desire in place that will be enough to
move you forward and then you trust in that desire
you follow that desire and you make sure you stick
to principles like radical open-mindedness and turning inward rather than
turning outward in your self-actualization efforts and you just keep
working that and of course you keep learning you keep
reading you keep watching videos you keep going to seminars
you keep meditating doing all these practices and you will
start to see yourself moving towards absolute infinity and then
one day it'll happen to you and then there's no
going back after that and if you do want technics
hell I've got plenty of videos that I've shot in
the past that explained many different techniques for how to
become enlightened go look at those I have a whole
playlist on actualize or the whole category called meditation and
enlightenment click on that category you'll see all my videos
related to that on my forum I also have Leo's
practical guide to enlightenment which is a long post where
I give you a guide step by step instructions for
how to do self inquiry so there's tons of techniques
available and my techniques are not the only techniques you
can go out there and find hundreds literally hundreds of
different techniques from all the spiritual schools from Christianity to
Buddhism to anything else I do happen to think that
my techniques are some of the most direct techniques that
you'll find out there a lot of the spiritual schools
will tend to hook out lead you around in circles
because well they are more committed to their traditions and
dogmas than they are to getting you directly to the
truth but there are good teachers out there so you
can go find them as well you can do meditation
retreats workshops and so on and that's it the only
lesson here really is to go experience it for yourself
everything I said here is not the truth all my
words are false all words can ever be relative to
the absolute is to be false so that's just the
nature of words don't get trapped by that consider this
as just poetry as me infecting you with some virus
which maybe you will or you won't actualize that is
up to you that's it here I'm signing off please
click the like button for me share this episode the
friend post your comments down below and come check out
actualized org I have resources there for you check out
the forum check out my blog check out my course
check out my book list all those will be helpful
in your journey to actualize the infinite and stick with
me in the future for more juicy episodes about this
and other topics as far as this series goes I
thought that there might be more parts than just two
but I think that we covered everything in these two
parts they were both kind of long I know but
this is just how the format turned out to be
so we're done with this series maybe in the long
distant future I'll shoot a part 3 or part 4
if I gather more information but that's it hope you
enjoyed you
