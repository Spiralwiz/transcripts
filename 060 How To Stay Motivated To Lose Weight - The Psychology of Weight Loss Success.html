            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/rkQab5RT2dc' target='_blank'>How To Stay Motivated To Lose Weight - The Psychology of Weight Loss Success</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Weight loss motivation</b>: Leo Gura talks about staying motivated to lose weight. He shares his personal journey of losing weight and emphasizes the importance of setting an inspiring weight loss goal. He comments that losing a larger amount of weight, such as 70 pounds, is often a more motivating goal than losing a negligible amount like 5 pounds due to the significant impact the former has on various aspects of life.
</li><li><b>Weight loss vision</b>: Gura underscores the importance of having a clear, sustainable vision for weight loss. He advises against temporary motivations like upcoming events or impressing others. He encourages listeners to identify and comprehend the changes that would occur in their life as a result of weight loss, and write down the top three in detail. 
</li><li><b>Realistic weight loss</b>: Gura discusses maintaining realistic expectations in the weight loss journey. He suggests that losing more than two pounds per week is unrealistic and could be detrimental to health. A motivational goal would be to lose around one pound per week, which can be achieved through a calorie deficit and dietary changes.
</li><li><b>Visualization and subconscious programming</b>: He suggests spending few minutes every day visualizing your goal and the benefits of achieving it. This approach helps to align the subconscious mind with the desired outcome and encourages consistent actions aligned with the weight loss goal.
</li><li><b>Habit formation</b>: Gura highlights that forming new habits, like going to the gym regularly or eating healthier, could take about 30 to 60 days. During this time, its vital to continually reinforce the goal and remind oneself about the purpose of these changes. 
</li><li><b>Long-term changes</b>: He conveys the importance of committing to long-term lifestyle changes rather than temporary dieting or exercise regimes. He suggests focusing on creating a strategy for weight loss that can be maintained indefinitely, by adopting a clean diet and consistent exercise patterns.
</li><li><b>Getting through the initial phase</b>: Gura shares that once you get past the challenging initial phase of establishing new habits, things tend to become easier. The initial period requires self-discipline, but after that, the subconscious mind starts to align with the new habits, leading to easier maintenance. 
</li><li><b>Leo Guras resources</b>: He concludes the section by suggesting visiting actualised.org for similar personal development videos and subscribing to his free newsletter.
</li><li><b>Affirmations As Motivation Tools</b>: Affirmations, short statements about what we want herein referred to as our goals, can be effective motivation tools when used consistently. By stating our goals as though we already achieved them, for instance, visualizing our goal weight and verbalizing this, we can motivate ourselves to achieve them.
</li><li><b>Revisiting Your Vision Daily</b>: It is essential to reconnect daily with our long-term weight loss vision. This means consciously reminding ourselves of our goals and why we embarked on the weight loss journey in the first place. This can be done through daily affirmations and visualization exercises.
</li><li><b>Building Habits Take Time</b>: Building a new habit, such as regular exercise, can take between 30 to 60 days initially. The beginning phase is usually difficult and requires a lot of discipline, but it eventually gets easier as the habit sets in.
</li><li><b>Anticipate Difficult Periods</b>: Expect periods during the weight loss journey where the motivation might wane. This often leads to a mental struggle where one part wants to give up and the other part wants to succeed. During these times, logically remind ourselves why we started and reaffirm the fact that it will get easier after the initial challenging phase.
</li><li><b>Fostering Subconscious Alignment With Goals</b>: Consistent habit routine contributes towards aligning our subconscious mind to our new habits. This means that as we continue to practice good eating and workout routines, it gradually becomes part of us, requiring less discipline and motivation.
</li><li><b>Taking One Day at a Time</b>: To avoid feeling overwhelmed, it is beneficial to focus on single-day targets. Trying to think too far ahead can be daunting. Our focus should be on doing what is required per day to meet our weight loss goals.
</li><li><b>Managing Willpower Variations</b>: Over the course of a day, our willpower to keep up with our weight loss routine might fluctuate, usually diminishing towards the end of the day. To manage this, remind ourselves of our single-day focus without burdening ourselves with thoughts of what is due in the coming days or weeks.
</li><li><b>Focus on one day at a time</b>: Leo suggests focusing only on today's diet and exercise plans, ensuring those are done correctly, and trusting that this approach will lead to successful weight loss over time. It eliminates the need for worrying about what to do in the future days.
</li><li><b>Lifelong commitment to health, not just a temporary diet</b>: When Leo decided to lose weight, he made a permanent change to his relationship with food and exercise. He committed to going to the gym for the rest of his life and made permanent changes to his eating habits.
</li><li><b>Sustainable lifestyle changes are key</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of making indefinitely sustainable changes. He stresses avoiding drastic changes that cannot be kept up in the long run, instead focusing on manageable changes like carving out regular gym time and avoiding problematic food for good.
</li><li><b>Planning ahead and setting proper expectations</b>: Leo recognizes the importance of planning and having realistic expectations when it comes to weight loss. He advises against expecting a loss of more than two pounds a week. Losing even one pound a week can be challenging, requiring a calorie deficit and potentially significant changes in diet.
</li><li><b>Consistency is vital to successful weight loss</b>: Leo asserts that consistent diet changes and regular gym attendance guarantee progress. He stresses the importance of giving oneself time to establish habits and begin seeing physical changes. 
</li><li><b>Improving overall life quality</b>: Leo suggests focusing on the long-term benefits such as improved confidence, better dating life, and enhanced sex life to stay motivated in the weight loss journey. He advises setting the right expectations for progress and not expecting too fast results. 
</li><li><b>Invite for engagement and further resources</b>: Leo welcomes viewers to share their challenges, feedback, and share the videos to help others. He also points viewers towards his website, actualised.org, for more advanced personal development videos and a free newsletter subscription.
