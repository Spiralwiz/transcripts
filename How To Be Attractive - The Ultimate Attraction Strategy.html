hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm gonna tell you how to be attractive okay
how to be attractive let's crack into it this is
gonna be a quick self-help segment but I'm gonna give
you the key not some sort of little gimmick and
I can go in and I give you a list
of a lot of little techniques and tips that you
can use to increase your attractiveness to the opposite sex
whether you're a guy or a girl but I'm gonna
actually give you something that's very deep and this is
gonna take some effort on your part to understand because
this is a profound idea that if you just take
this principle and you apply it to your life the
amount of attraction that you will generate from the opposite
sex is gonna be ridiculous this is such a powerful
idea and in this segment I'm just gonna focus on
it and one little point at the end but what
is this idea let's get into it so here it
is and you might not like it but this is
why it's powerful I want you to be completely detached
from needing anyone to fulfill you in your life all
right what does this mean this means that I want
you to realize and this is a deeper truth that
you will realize with enough personal development work that you
do not need anyone in your life to make you
happy or fulfilled despite what it might seem like right
now no I know what you might be saying you
may be saying well Leo the whole point of getting
into a relationship is because I want I want to
have love I want to have compassion I want to
have excitement I want to do all these fun things
I want to find my soul mate maybe I want
to get married I want to have children I want
to raise a good family all of these things you
know nothing wrong with that that's all well and good
but I can guarantee you that the biggest problem that
you're having if you're not being Proactive in a relationship
is not that you're not pretty enough or that you're
behaving in some weird ways or you're doing something incorrectly
it's this general idea this philosophy this mindset that you're
going into the relationship with the need for somebody to
be your second half to fulfill you and it's very
easy to get caught up in this because mainstream media
puts out this notion of what love and romance and
relationships are like if we watch movies and watch stories
and listen to fairy tales we get this picture that
love is this finding somebody else to complete you that
is not what true love is that is not what
a healthy relationship is a healthy relationship is one in
which both parties both the man and the woman or
whatever your relationship ends up being girl girl guy guy
girl guy doesn't matter you need to be confident and
independent and happy by yourself and so does the other
person and only then can you two come together and
create something that is greater than the sum of its
parts this is a hard idea to get wrap your
head around because especially if you're feeling lonely right now
and you're feeling like you're lacking something in your life
and you feel like well if only I had that
guy or that girl if only I had that love
that I had maybe in a previous relationship if I
could rekindle that kind of spark again then I would
be happy I would be content my life would be
complete well that's the problem that's highly unattractive to the
opposite sex there are actually two points here first is
the more shallow point the surface-level point that it's simply
actually repulsive to the other person and that when you're
coming from that mind frame you're actually going to be
repelling rather than attracting people that's because well when you
are desperate and when you're needy other people do not
want to be around you at least not the kind
of person that you want in your life what you're
gonna attract when you're needy and desperate is you're gonna
retract somebody else who's on that same level so you
might attract someone who also going to be needy and
desperate or you might not attract anyone at all that's
definitely not someone you want is a needy and desperate
person that's going to create a dysfunctional codependent relationship instead
what you want is you want to attract someone who's
equally confident and stable and happy in themselves just as
they are so that when you two come together things
click and things are good now this goes deeper to
the reason that you do not want to be in
this needy desperate position is because actually what you're doing
is you're being inauthentic to yourself you're not really in
touch with the fact that you can be happy by
yourself and what you're actually looking for is you're looking
for a crutch and you're using this other person even
though you call it love and you call it romance
and fulfillment actually what you're doing is you're using that
other person as a crutch to fill a void in
your own ego that is there and here's the thing
here's the really mind-blowing thing is that even if you
get that person and you find that perfect person to
fit that hole that boy that you have in yourself
it's not actually gonna work it's no different than going
out there for example and you know that stereotypical businessman
that goes out there and tries to dominate the corporate
ladder and tries to earn a million dollars and thinks
that that's gonna make him happy and then when he
gets to the end of that whole journey he finds
out that he's no happier than when he started that's
very very true from a money perspective but it's also
very true from a relationship perspective if you think that
somebody else is gonna come in there and fulfill you
fulfill that gap in your ego it's not gonna happen
and here's why because you're actually running away from something
there's something within you within your own psychology that you're
not facing up to and when you avoid that by
just going and getting a quick fix of sex or
companionship or love or marriage or starting a family whatever
that is all that's doing is that putting a band-aid
over a much deeper wound that you have within yourself
because honestly you do not need anyone to be happy
in this applies for everybody in the entire world you
can be completely be all by yourself you do not
need anyone to fulfill you and if you feel like
that's not true for you well then I've got a
shocking revelation and that is because you have not done
enough introspection and have not figured out what your quirks
are what your limiting beliefs are what your ego deficiencies
are you have not done enough personal development work to
get that part of your life handled so what I'm
telling you is get that part of your life handled
be detached and you will be attractive so not only
will you be attractive you'll also be fulfilled which is
really even more important but with the attractiveness thing what's
attractive to the opposite sex two guys and two girls
is to be able to be completely authentic 100% authentic
and to be a completely 100% authentic you have to
be able to be confident in who you are and
you have to be able to let people come and
go into your life without needing to clutch onto them
and cling to them and hold them now this applies
whether you're single right now or you're you're in some
sort of Burrill girlfriend-boyfriend relationship or even if you're married
all right even if you're married you should not be
attached to your spouse you should not need that spouse
to be in your life if you do then I
got a very high probability of predicting that that marriage
or that relationship is gonna go sour within a few
years maybe even sooner or maybe within five years or
ten years but in the end it's not gonna be
able to last because it's built on something that's fake
it's not authentic you could not be authentic with someone
that you need something from generally what you really need
to come into a deep realization of and this is
something that I've been doing as I've been doing more
meditation more enlightenment work on myself is I've been really
coming to this deep understanding that there is nothing that
anyone in the world can offer me that I cannot
offer myself now of course that doesn't mean that I
can fix my own plumbing or I can repair my
own car or I can grow my own food I
need people for that sure we depend on each other
for those kinds of things weirdest is that we live
in a society what I'm talking about the psychological dependency
you do needs someone to fulfill you psychologically at least
you shouldn't right now that is most likely not the
case for you it takes a lot of work to
get to the point where you're really there I'm not
there myself I'm working on this right now very actively
but you need to start getting more awareness of this
is that the more psychological dependencies you have on your
parents on your siblings on your spouse on your children
on your boss on anyone in life as long as
you think that they can really give you something of
value then what's gonna happens you're gonna set you're gonna
feel a need to sacrifice your own authenticity you're not
going to be able to express yourself the way that
you want to express yourself and that is what's actually
most attractive and most magnetic within people when you see
people like celebrities or you see someone that you're really
attracted to the reason that is is because that person
is totally out come independent right they're comfortable being themselves
and they're happy by themselves they actually are happy they're
not faking it this is not some sort of fake
detachment this is a real I am happy with my
life I really don't need anything else to complete it
if you want to come in here and you want
to kind of intermingle with what I've got going on
then let's do that let's see if it'll work we'll
try that and that's the base of a strong relationship
and you know what if it doesn't work something doesn't
go right then we'll just gonna we're just gonna like
bounce our separate ways and no hard feelings because I'm
happy I expect you to be happy and that's just
how it is right it's like to non-needy entities coming
into contact with each other and just seeing how it's
gonna play out versus the way that a normal relationship
works and this is what I would define as a
dysfunctional relationship is two people coming together needing something from
the other I need sex from you you need security
for me you want comfort from me you want love
for me I want excitement from you and I want
a partner from you and I want money from you
you know when you've got this kind of trade this
kind of tit-for-tat going then neither party is gonna be
able to be completely authentic because what's going to happen
is you're always gonna have that fear deep down that
well hold on if I do something that that person
disapproves up that that person doesn't like then I'm gonna
risk upsetting I'm gonna do something that maybe they're gonna
stop loving me maybe they're gonna get angry they're gonna
get upset and they're gonna pull something away from me
right they're gonna pull their love away they're gonna pull
their their their comfort away from me and when you're
in that kind of relationship that's a relationship based on
fear that's a dysfunctional relationship so if you want to
be really authentically attractive then what you got to do
is you got to really work on this and I
means working on yourself working on your own psychology working
on your own quirks you know why is it that
you feel that you need that love so badly why
do you thirst after it why do you need that
companionship so much why are not why are you not
comfortable in who you are why can't you be comfortable
just by yourself without needing anybody else these are the
issues you got to really work out now the next
point is that I really want you to create a
happy life for yourself so that means that if you're
sitting home alone right now and you cannot be happy
by yourself without going out and distracting yourself with some
sort of stimulation television internet sex drugs alcohol whatever if
you're not able to just be comfortable and happy by
yourself then you've got some work to do realize that
you've got some work to do and I also want
you to set up a good life for yourself with
nice external circumstances so that means for example make sure
that you have a rich life have a good career
have something that you're passionate about your life have a
life purpose have some nice friends that you like to
hang out with have some hobbies that you enjoy have
your money situation handled make sure you're unhooked from addictions
like drugs smoking alcohol overeating make sure you're happy with
your family life make sure you have your health and
your hygiene in order when you've got all this stuff
you're gonna be happy and also you're gonna work on
your psychology beyond that right so you got your psychology
down you've got all these external factors in your life
down now you've created an awesome life for yourself now
you can be authentic now as long as you're just
interacting with people and you're out and about and you
have chances to bump into other people then they're gonna
see you being happy and being confident and being completely
authentic and not eating anything and they're gonna be like
oh that's kind of cool I rarely need a person
like that and they're gonna get attracted to you don't
discount how powerful this is it seems a little bit
abstract maybe airy-fairy hard to believe I'm telling you that
this is really the secret of building lasting non gimmicky
attraction and the last point that I'm going to make
as I'm wrapping up here is really take care of
your body and take care of your hygiene take care
of your health make sure you're eating well make sure
that you're taking care of basic hygiene stuff brushing your
teeth showering every day doing your you know your yoga
your meditation your gym routine following up on that eating
healthy cleaning up your diet these are some very practical
things and they might seem shallow but really the reason
you're doing them is you're doing them for you I
get to create a happy life for yourself but they're
also going to make you attractive because if you're taking
care of yourself to the best of your ability and
you've got your psychology down and your life is awesome
I mean who would not want to be a part
of that of course they would everyone wants to be
a part of that what people are repelled by is
neediness you coming into a relationship and just wanting more
for me me me me it's like I need this
I need that I need you for me to feel
happy nobody wants to really be in a relationship like
that not a healthy person a dysfunctional person might and
then that will create something that you are not going
to want anyways alright so that's it this is the
deep underlying truth of how to be attractive don't listen
to the gimmicks solve this problem nip it in the
butt by addressing your need for other people you really
don't need other people find out why you're not happy
