            <ul>
    <li><b>Role of a Harsh Teacher</b>: Leo likens himself to a Zen master who uses direct, intense methods to guide students towards enlightenment, even if it seems harsh. He emphasizes he behaves this way not out of malice but to shake people out of their complacency and push them towards self-realization.
</li><li><b>Adapting to Different Learning Needs</b>: Leo varies his approach based on the individual. If a person is visibly struggling and lost, he adopts a patient, caring stance to offer guidance. However, if someone knows better but behaves foolishly, he uses a direct, sharp approach to snap them out of their inertia.
</li><li><b>Awakening the "Sleeping" Audience</b>: Leo asserts his harsh approach aims to stir those who are "asleep" - living in ignorance or dismissive about their needed growth. He argues that sparing someone's ego or coddling them might feel good but prevent real growth, insisting some people need a jolt to recognize the errors in their ways and trigger change.
</li><li><b>Aesthetic of Teaching</b>: Leo acknowledges his harshness may be perceived as him being a "dick," but he insists it's necessary for effective teaching. He explains his intention isn't to hurt but to create discomfort, often necessary for substantial personal growth, mirroring the Zen master's practice of physically waking dozing students.
</li><li><b>Challenges in Video Content Creation</b>: Leo touches on the struggles of conveying deep wisdom through videos, balancing the need to be impactful yet respectful of the limited time he has with the audience. He emphasizes the necessity to occasionally shake up viewers to ensure the message goes beyond surface-level understanding.
</li><li><b>Challenges of a True Teacher</b>: Leo explains that a true teacher often has to be ruthless and direct to guide students effectively. Some students do not respond well to a gentle approach, hence requiring to be pushed hard. This ruthlessness is not personal but meant to direct a student onto the right path.
</li><li><b>Approach in Teaching Personal Development</b>: Leo suggests that in personal development, being very compassionate and positive all the time is not beneficial. Having dreams and positive thinking is crucial but these need to be grounded on solid principles. Teachers should clearly outline right and wrong, with no grey areas, so as to prevent a mentality of laziness and self-destructive acts.
</li><li><b>Guidance in Personal Development</b>: Frequent guidance and reminder of personal development principles is necessary throughout life. Leo provides free resources such as videos and articles on personal development through his newsletter. These resources are intended to guide you in growing constantly.
</li><li><b>Goals in Personal Development</b>: Leo believes that with continuous learning and following his teachings, anyone can achieve their life goals, including self-actualization, enlightenment, career success, fulfilling relationships, good health, and financial stability. Personal satisfaction comes with personal growth, according to Leo. 
</li><li><b>Appropriate Teaching Styles</b>: Leo admits that determining when to use a softer approach or a harder approach with his students is something he is still figuring out. He acknowledges making mistakes but reassures that he learns fast from them. It's all part of him trying to be beneficial to his students, even if it might look like he's being a 'dick'.
