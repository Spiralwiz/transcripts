            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/JhV9f1l3H1A' target='_blank'>40 Signs That You Are Neurotic - Understanding Neurosis</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Definition of neurosis</b>: Neurosis is a technical term from old school psychology that is at the root of most problems people experience in life. Neurosis makes people miserable and is characterized by various signs from anxiety, obsessive thoughts, compulsive behavior to phobias, paranoia, constant criticism, blaming others, and stubbornness among others.
</li><li><b>Neurosis as conflict within the individual</b>: Neurosis represents an internal struggle in an individual, a conflict between what he is and what he believes he should be. It involves the ego attempting to exert control over the body, the rational mind trying to control feelings, and the will attempting to overcome fears and anxieties.
</li><li><b>Characteristics of neurotic behavior</b>: Neurotic behavior includes actions like striving to overcome fears and anxieties, which further exacerbates the internal struggle within the individual. The breakdown of unity and integrity in the individual results in a depletion of energy and destruction of peace of mind.
</li><li><b>Neurosis as resistance to living a full life</b>: Neurosis is often regarded as fear of life. A neurotic individual is scared to fully express themselves, be fully present, and accept love. They are apprehensive about more life or feeling which they fear might threaten their ego, flood their boundaries, and undermine their identity.
</li><li><b>The role of acceptance in overcoming neurosis</b>: Neurosis is a struggle most individuals cannot win because it invariably involves resistance to self-acceptance. By accepting failure in this struggle, individuals become free of their neurosis. This paradox further reinforces the complex nature of neurosis. 
</li><li><b>Identification of neurosis</b>: Neurosis is identified through a variety of signs such as anxiety, obsessive thoughts, compulsive behavior, vague physical ailments like chronic fatigue syndrome and insomnia, depression, suicidal thoughts, anger or rage, social maladjustment, dysfunctional relationships, inability to work, money problems, addictions, perfectionism, workaholism, constant stress, chronic lying, restlessness, overeating, phobias, paranoia and being easily offended among others.
</li><li><b>Understanding Neurosis from Multiple Perspectives</b>: Neurosis is a distorted perspective of the world and self, driven by compulsive needs rather than genuine interest. It may manifest as excessive needs in life, rather than wants, indicating a lack of acceptance for reality and self. 
</li><li><b>False Assumptions and Neurosis</b>: People often mistakenly assume that if they don't need something, it can't or shouldn't be part of their lives. This misunderstanding is rooted in a neurotic mindset.
</li><li><b>Refusal to Accept Present Reality</b>: Neurosis constitutes a refusal to accept present reality, with neurotics consistently demanding life to be different from what it is. They deny reality and themselves, indicating a lack of self-acceptance.
</li><li><b>Self-Denial</b>: Neurotics often deny their true nature and strive to be different, resulting in a lack of self-acceptance. They vilify parts of themselves, viewing them as evil or unacceptable, which adds to their struggles.
</li><li><b>Rigidity and Rule-Keeping</b>: Neurotic individuals create personal rules and expect others to abide by them. They vehemently defend their belief systems without considering other viewpoints. This rigidness seeps into how they view and treat themselves, others, and different situations.
</li><li><b>Imposed Rules and Freedom</b>: Neurotics often unknowingly internalized rules and laws during their upbringing, especially when raised in a religious backdrop. They mistakenly believe that these rules enhance their morality, but they, in fact, limit their freedom and induce neurotic behavior.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment and Neurosis</b>: Enlightened individuals are inherently anti-neurotic. They do not adhere to a predefined set of rules or principles but are guided by their awareness and understanding. This offers them innate freedom and a higher level of morality compared to those who follow external rules. 
</li><li><b>Neurotics' Fear of Freedom</b>: Neurotics fear that without their firmly established rules and beliefs, they might spiral into chaos. Hence they cling to their ideologies and resist embracing the freedom that comes with trust and self-acceptance.
</li><li><b>Internal Dialogues and Arguments</b>: Neurotics frequently engage in internal dialogues, often arguing with realities and how things should be different from what they are. This constant internal conflict can lead to emotional drain and unhappiness.
</li><li><b>Neuroses as internal conflict</b>: People with neurotic tendencies often engage in constant internal dialogues revolving around "should" statements or regret, unknowingly sapping the joy from their lives. This can lead to an ongoing condition of victimhood, anger, or depression. 
</li><li><b>Emotional avoidance in neurosis</b>: Neurotic individuals tend to avoid emotions due to their unpredictable nature. They try to control emotions with logic, which often leads to perpetual internal conflict. This conflict, mostly unconscious, can negatively impact several aspects of life including relationships, business, self-esteem, and general happiness.
</li><li><b>Neurosis as self-sabotage</b>: Consistent patterns of self-sabotaging behavior, whether in work, relationships, or personal goals, are a manifestation of neurosis. The neurotic perspective often mistakenly assumes that action without deep self-understanding can overcome these patterns. 
</li><li><b>Neurosis as forced action</b>: Many neurotic individuals rely heavily on self-discipline to achieve their goals, often employing guilt and fear as motivators. This harsh approach breaks personal integrity and fails to foster trust and confidence in one's endeavours.
</li><li><b>Neurosis vs. self-understanding</b>: Neurotic people regularly look for external solutions to their problems, while the deeper solutions reside inwardly. However, they often struggle with the concept of introspection due to a lack of self-understanding.
</li><li><b>The link between self-love, self-acceptance, and neurosis</b>: Harsh self-discipline and self-punishment stemming from neurosis typically indicate a lack of self-love and self-acceptance, which in turn affects the individual's ability to show compassion and love towards others.
</li><li><b>Neurosis as dysfunction and 'ass-backwards' living</b>: Neurosis encapsulates a dysfunctional way of living that rejects the reality of the present situation and constantly aims for a different, often unreal, state of affairs. The neurotic mind has trouble turning inwardly for solutions and finds the idea of surrendering to reality unacceptable. Self-awareness and the acceptance of reality are key to overcoming this neurotic pattern.
</li><li><b>Understanding neurosis</b>: According to Leo Gura, the opposite of neurosis is peace of mind, and this involves accepting reality and oneself as it is. This acceptance should coincide with self-improvement and striving for authenticity. However, such self-development must occur without a neurotic mindset of reaching an ideal state.
</li><li><b>Obtaining peace of mind</b>: Leo suggests that true peace of mind can be achieved through enlightenment and the practice of self-actualization. He stresses the irony in his teachings where he encourages both acceptance of oneself and taking action for improvement, which could seem contradictory. The goal is to reach an understanding of reality and one's authentic self, which helps in overcoming neurosis.
</li><li><b>Everyone is neurotic</b>: Leo acknowledges that everyone harbors a degree of neurosis, regardless of their societal success. It is this inherent neurotic behavior, according to him, that leaves people unfulfilled despite material wealth or achievement.
</li><li><b>Commitments for overcoming neurosis</b>: For those wishing to overcome neurotic behavior, Leo suggests making commitments to acknowledge and address their neurotic nature. He emphasizes the importance of admitting one's neurotic tendencies, vowing to identify the roots of their neuroses, aligning themselves with empirical reality, letting go of socially instilled beliefs, and embarking on a journey of gradual self-improvement. 
</li><li><b>Final assignment</b>: As a step towards self-improvement, Leo encourages viewers to list down their top five neurotic behaviors and delve into their root causes. This activity focuses on increasing self-awareness and understanding of their neuroses.
</li><li><b>Value of Actualized.org</b>: Leo highlights the importance of staying committed to self-improvement and suggests that his platform, Actualized.org, can provide essential guidance, motivation, and relevant information to keep viewers on track. He assures viewers that with dedicated effort and time, they can expect substantial positive changes in their lives.
