[Music] welcome in this episode we're gonna be talking about
self bias this is an exciting topic that I've been
wanting to talk about for four years now in some
great lengths because this is a core problem of epistemology
and epistemology remember don't get confused by this word all
it means is the theory of human knowledge so how
do we know anything as human beings well soft bias
turns out to play a very important role so what
is self bias it's a term that I coined when
I was in my teenage years when I first started
doing philosophy I was about 18 years old in high
school and in early college and I started reading various
philosophies trying to figure out life you know I didn't
have a particular philosophy that I subscribed to because I
didn't know which philosophy was true I had an open
mind and so what I did I was just reading
various kinds of philosophical literature but what I noticed is
a very peculiar phenomenon in philosophy maybe you've noticed this
as well is that every philosophical school presents arguments in
favor of its own position and against other positions which
are not its own so atheists will present arguments for
why there is no God Christians will present arguments for
why there is a God and why Christ is the
one true prophet Muslims will present arguments for why Islam
is the one true faith and that Allah is the
highest God and that Muhammad is the greatest prophet scientists
will present arguments for science and against witchcraft and against
voodoo and against mysticism and other forms of knowing rationalists
will present rational arguments for why rationality is correct empiricist
will present empirical arguments for why empiricism is correct realists
will argue that reality is real idealist will reaaargh you
that reality is just some idea in the mind of
God skeptics will argue for scepticism conservatives will argue for
conservativism liberals will argue for liberalism post modernists will argue
for post-modernism and on it goes and what baffled me
as I was studying these various schools of thought is
that I noticed a meta pattern amongst all these different
schools and philosophers which was that all of them were
biased towards their own position and against those of others
I didn't see fair treatment I didn't see a scientist
fairly considering the position of the Muslim I didn't see
a Muslim fairly considering the position of the skeptic or
the atheist I didn't see the atheist fairly considering the
position of someone practicing witchcraft I didn't see conservatives fairly
honestly genuinely trying to understand the position of liberals nor
the opposite and this immediately struck me as the number
one problem of all of life because how am I
supposed to discover what's true if I myself am gonna
act this way if I'm just gonna present skewed arguments
towards my own pet theories then I'm not genuinely inquiring
into the actual nature of reality I don't actually care
about what the truth is all that I'm doing is
I'm playing a persuasion game where I'm trying to persuade
others to believe what I believe and of course in
the process I'm also first and foremost trying to persuade
myself with these talking points that what I believe is
true and that I actually understand reality when in fact
I don't and so the key error that I found
throughout all of Western philosophy is that no Western philosopher
seriously acknowledges their own self bias and of course this
isn't just limited to philosophy we're talking about all basically
intellectual pursuits and this struck me as a huge problem
and I didn't see anybody talking about this problem which
struck me is kind of odd because it seems so
obvious so such an important problem and I didn't see
any solutions to this problem either there were no simple
solutions because what I was interested in I was interested
in truth I didn't care what the truth was per
se my position was that whatever the truth is even
if it's ugly or even for contradicts everything that I
believe I would rather have that than my own pet
theories and so with this I began a serious investigation
to the nature of life and reality and human knowledge
which ultimately led me to actualize that org and to
mysticism to non-duality to enlightenment and all of that so
the biggest obstacle in philosophy is that truth requires impartiality
and objectivity but how do you be impartial it's not
nearly as easy as people assume you might think well
okay I'll just be impartial I'll just do an impartial
investigation into all the different philosophies and then I'll find
the true right one but the problem goes much deeper
than this you see because it's very tricky who is
going to judge whether you're being objective or impartial because
it's not enough just to tell yourself that your objective
and impartial because of course you're the judge and the
jury and the one on trial in this case see
so who are you gonna ask whether you're actually truly
being objective are you gonna ask yourself and then what
is your mind gonna tell you of course it's gonna
tell you that you are objective the whole problem is
that all of these different philosophies and schools believe that
their objective and that their impartial you ask a Christian
or a Muslim if they're impartial and what are they
gonna say yes I mean what are they gonna say
no of course they're gonna say that they're impartial but
see the problem is is that if you are self
biased already towards a certain position then you're not gonna
be able to see your own self bias and therefore
your bias is gonna be the problem because if you're
gonna just blindly follow your bias your bias will just
say well Christianity is true how do I know it's
true well because I say it's true same thing for
science and anything else see there's a question begging going
on here with all these different worldviews that I want
you to notice the person doesn't truly question the very
foundations of their worldview because it's just taken for granted
and it's not even realized that it could be a
problem it's just assumed that it's valid so for example
you ask a scientists well how do you know science
is true why are you a scientist why do you
trust in science and the scientists will tell you this
whole spiel about the history of science and all the
technology that's been invented and how good science is and
the scientific method and how it's all been much better
than all the alternatives like witchcraft and voodoo and mysticism
and religion and all that nonsense and that of course
we know science is objective and impartial but how do
you know that the problem is is that the scientist
is going to use scientific and rational arguments to try
to validate science but that's begging the question because the
very thing that we're trying to question here is how
do we know that the very mechanism the epistemic mechanism
that you're using all those scientific mythological assumptions how do
you know those actually lead to truth the scientists will
of course use further science to try to prove that
science leads to truth which is exactly as absurd as
asking a Christian why do you believe in God and
then the question says well because because of the Bible
and then why do you believe in the Bible well
because God wrote the Bible and God wouldn't lie see
it's a it's a vicious circle because what we're questioning
here is did God really write the Bible did God
really not lie or maybe God is a liar how
do you know well Leo the Bible says God can't
be a liar yeah but what we're questioning is is
the Bible correct so you can't assume that the Bible
is correct nor can you assume that God is not
a liar maybe God is a liar you don't know
maybe the devil wrote the Bible you don't know if
you're being objective and impartial the problem though is precisely
that you're being a partial you're you're not being objective
you're favoring the thing that you're trying to prove and
so in this sense you're not actually making it proof
so what I'm telling you is that most scientists who
buy into science they don't buy into science because they've
proven that science is valid it's actually the other way
around they buy into science and therefore they then rigged
their entire scheme of justifications and all of their logic
to validate that science is correct they assume the science
correct and then they use science to validate the sciences
correct same thing for Muslims Christians Jews and everybody else
and so this is the mechanism that I saw when
I was about 18 years old this shook me to
my core it changed my life forever when I realized
this this wasn't something I read in a book or
that somebody told me I sat down one night late
at night by myself in my room I can still
vividly remember the night with just a sheet of paper
kinda reason this stuff through and when I saw this
when I saw this infinite black hole of Grau miss
into which all of these worldviews and philosophies ultimately vortex
their way down into because they're all groundless they're all
predicated upon circular reasoning when I saw that it really
shook me it really opened up my mind and that
was the doorway towards ultimately being able to understand awakening
but that would take decades for me to really understand
it I didn't know at the time that I was
just like licking the tip of the iceberg of how
deep this problem goes this basically explains why people tricked
themselves into believing all sorts of crazy worldviews they don't
have enough consciousness or awareness to see that question begging
nature of their own self bias see isn't it funny
how if you ask a Christian are you biased they
always say no and if you ask a scientist are
you biased he says of course not I'm a scientist
our whole objective is not to be biased but then
you can go around and do that with every single
crazy belief and worldview that people have held since the
dawn of time and they will all deny that they're
biased so what good is the denial what's it worth
it hey what [ __ ] and that's when I
started to really suspect a problem within science I saw
that scientists were not seriously interested in this problem because
generally scientists are just interested in like executing science they're
not interested in questioning science not very deeply because they
just assume it to be true and why do they
assume to be true because they weren't doctrine ated into
it in their culture when they were growing up through
their schooling and through university and so forth through their
parents through TV shows through books they read through science
fiction or whatever and the same thing goes for Christians
atheists and everybody else it's nothing very original is happening
here and nobody is really being intelligent they're just executing
they're executing preexisting conditioning and programming and so I started
to question all this and so at this point in
my life I started to identify most with being a
skeptic because to me skeptics were the closest of all
the different schools of thought especially the ancient Greek skeptics
the Peroni ins were the closest to taking this problem
seriously everybody else seemed to just kind of gloss over
it as though it's not a big deal and even
when I entered philosophy in university I became a philosophy
major and I was taking philosophy classes and even there
when I brought up this issue in class I noticed
that even professional philosophers and all of my classmates did
not take this issue seriously and that's when I understood
how deep the problem goes at that point I realized
because my my career plans at that point where that
I was going to become a professional philosopher I wanted
to become a professor and I thought that what am
I break through achievements within professional philosophy within my career
you know I still very naive at that point I
didn't know how anything worked I don't know how the
world worked I didn't know how to business how business
work I didn't know how academia works or how science
professionally works but I quickly learned that um so anyway
yeah so I thought that I would introduce this giant
nuclear weapon into into philosophy that would blow the whole
thing up I kind of wanted to undermine it from
within with this sort of toxic form of skepticism that
I was practicing but I saw that you can't be
a professional philosopher as a-- as one of these toxic
skeptics because the whole industry and it is an industry
is built upon basically all of Western civilization is built
upon building up worldviews not breaking them down and so
at that point I realized that well there goes my
philosophy career I can't be a philosopher so that was
very interesting so anyways enough about me so let's articulate
a bit more explicitly what is self bias self bias
and I'll give you a few different definitions of it
here that I came up with number one it's the
minds natural tendency to favor its own intellectual positions above
others it's also whim your worldview is question begging and
you can't see how it is question begging and furthermore
all worldviews are question begging it's when you're unable to
fairly and objectively evaluate your own worldview relative to others
when you give preferential treatment when you construct arguments and
justifications and various double standards for why your worldview is
superior to others so for example if you're an atheist
you're going to have double standards about the kind of
logic that you use to justify atheism over theism you're
not going to admit for example that atheism is a
hypothesis or that it's held as a position of faith
or as a dogma because you want to differentiate yourself
from the theists see you wanna you want to accuse
the theists of being dogmatic and being faith-based whereas you
want your position as an atheist to be scientific and
rooted in reason and logic and and facts and evidence
and that's the thing that you're using to differentiate between
you and theists but what I'm telling you is that
actually when you're doing that you're not being fair because
you already assume that atheism must be true therefore what
you do is you skew all of your arguments and
reasoning such that it favors the correct outcome that you
you have assumed is the correct outcome so you're actually
reasoning backwards you're putting the cart before the horse you
have already determined in your mind in the back of
your mind what the correct conclusion should be you haven't
actually done any inquiry into whether there is a God
or not you haven't actually gone out and like looked
under a rock God are you there you haven't like
gone looked into the bushes you know God are you
in there answer me you haven't done this you haven't
you just assume that there's no God of course likewise
the theists have succumbed to the same problem they also
haven't gone and looked under a rock or under a
tree or whatever to find God they just assume that
God is there and another way to phrase what south
bias is is that it's an irrational favoring of one's
own worldview and a creation of various kinds of pseudo
evidence and pseudo proofs that seem to justify your worldview
but which are actually ultimately groundless and viciously circular self
bias is why our legal system has a notion called
conflict of interest and recusal you've probably heard about this
a judge or a lawyer is supposed to recuse himself
from a certain trial if he's materially involved in some
manner with the prosecution or with the defense if he
has a a horse in the race he needs to
recuse himself and there are various ethic boards within government
for example ethics lawyers which will consult with politicians and
so forth and advise them to recuse themselves in certain
situations where there's conflict of interest for example you know
if I'm taking money from a defense contractor as a
judge and then I have to judge a court case
where somebody is suing this defense contractor for negligence or
some such thing well I have to recuse myself because
if there's a conflict of interest it's hard for me
to be objective when my survival is at stake and
so in in a fair court system one of the
most important things that the judges are objective and unbiased
they really have to not have a horse in the
race they can't say well that's a man and that's
a woman and you know I favor the man over
the woman just because you know well I don't like
women because some woman in the past did me wrong
like my wife she she cheated on me so therefore
now you know women they can't be trusted so she's
gonna lose the kid and you can't be a judge
this way I mean you can but that would be
corrupt and that would be untruthful and you could see
how that would be a very big problem if all
judges were like that so see in the legal system
we recognize a problem with self bias we just we
don't call it self bias we recognize it the problem
though is that this problem extends way beyond the legal
system we need to really extend our notion of conflict
of interest and recusal way beyond the legal system to
include business to include science to include religion and many
other things where it isn't taken seriously the self who
you are is the lens through which you see the
world and it's that lens that self which then distorts
your perception of reality not just your perception but reality
itself science logic emotions actions decisions relationships all of this
gets distorted by who you are and all of us
are trying to be somebody unique somebody different somebody else
or even if you're conforming then that's even worse you're
trying to be that and then that distorts your perception
so the reason we care about any of this you
might wonder like what what's the big deal leo well
the big deal is we care about having an accurate
perception of reality that's what we really care about that's
not a way of saying we care about the truth
but the truth is a tricky thing how do you
get to the truth when you're always looking at it
from the lens of yourself how do you get outside
of yourself when you're stuck inside of yourself see triki
triki triki not only do you need to see this
entire mechanism at the metal level that I'm describing here
of self bias but you also then need to go
even further that's not enough just to see yourself being
biased you also have to relinquish your biases are you
willing to do that to actually get a clear picture
of reality most people aren't I want you to notice
that after all how can you see reality clearly if
you're preoccupied with survival if I'm a judge and let's
say I love to gamble and so I've gambled away
my life savings to the point where I'm almost bankrupt
I'm gonna lose my house and if I lose my
house my wife and my children they're probably gonna leave
me and because of all these problems I also have
a drinking problem on top of this because drinking is
what I use to to calm my nerves and keep
this anxiety and keep some of these problems at bay
and and but I'm a judge so you know I
asked respectable in the morning when I show up to
the courtroom and now I have this this decision this
important decision in front of me between some some corporations
a big drug company that accidentally you know killed some
some innocent person because they gave the wrong drug or
whatever yeah and now the drug company comes to me
and offers me a million dollars for ruling in their
favor because you know if they lose this lawsuit it
could mean a 10 million dollar loss for them not
to mention oh if they lose this lawsuit other people
will jump on the bandwagon they will keep suing them
in the end for this company it might end up
costing them a hundred million dollars to lose this lawsuit
so they're glad to pay me a million to rule
in their favor how can I say no because I've
put myself in this terrible position where I need to
survive if I say no I'm gonna lose my entire
life so saying no isn't really an option for me
unless of course I have very very high integrity and
I really value the truth to the point where I'm
even able to say I value the truth so much
that I am willing to lose my wife my house
my children my whole life to be objective in this
in this trial but you know but you see how
easy it is to corrupt a person because who is
gonna give up their life their children their house or
life just for the sake of the truth in this
situation you know in most in most judicial matters in
most judicial verdicts like are you are you really gonna
be able to tell whether I was biased as a
judge or not usually not many many judicial verdicts come
down to like a 50/50 split they're very close so
you know if somebody pays me a million dollars and
I just happen to lean towards them a little bit
it was any harm really done I was probably gonna
rule in their favor anyways right it's like you know
I was even if they didn't give me a million
dollars I was still probably gonna rule in favor because
because all they presented all this good logic and facts
and evidence for why for that for why this this
defendant it really doesn't doesn't deserve to get a 10
million dollar reward see you see how easy the mind
plays tricks on you when your survival is at play
that's the problem fundamentally when we're pursuing the truth is
that we're pursuing the truth at a potentially great cost
to ourselves so why would we do that well that's
a very good question we'll get to that about a
bit later see people think it's about choosing or deciding
who's right and who's wrong which religion is right which
is wrong which person is right which is wrong in
a debate it's not about that it's about a meta
problem it's about realizing that your mind will always find
a way to feel that it's right your mind will
always just a any core metaphysical positions that you have
which serve your survival why do people denies self bias
because and this is very twisted and ironic it doesn't
benefit the self to admit of self bias see there's
no benefit to a Christian to admit that his worldview
is biased and there's no benefit to a scientist to
admit that his world team is bias in fact there's
a great cost because if a Christian actually admitted the
possibility just the possibility that his worldview is biased then
that creates doubt a doubt which will seep into the
cracks of his worldview and corrode it from within until
the foundation cracks and crumbles and then he's gonna face
an extension crisis well if Christianity is not true and
maybe there's no God then what oh my god that's
terrible who's who's correct then what should I believe should
I believe the scientists should I believe the nihilus who
should I believe see then you're lost so if you're
already committed to being selfish for the pursuit of survival
which of course you are you had to be in
order to be alive that's how you survived this far
in your life so you're committed to it but if
you already are committed to it then there's no benefit
to you admitting that you're selfish so people deny it
another reason that people deny self bias is because the
the genuine is not because they're malicious or evil in
the classical sense but rather it's because they lack the
awareness to see the circularity at the center of their
worldview they generally they genuinely don't see it scientists genuinely
believe that there's no vicious circularity within science within the
foundations of science genuinely believe that there's no vicious circularity
within Christianity see they they don't even take this problem
seriously they just consider this as aw it's just philosophy
mental masturbation doesn't have any real real consequences who really
cares see of course because they're self biased to care
about the things that I'm talking about you'd already have
to not be so fast because the things I'm talking
about here are very threatening and dangerous to any worldview
another reason people deny self bias is because they conflate
selfishness with truth when you're very selfish to you anything
that serves you appears as though it's the truth and
anything that doesn't serve you appears as though it's falsehood
there's this conflation conversely people also tend to think in
this situation that by pursuing the truth they will be
personally benefited and so if they're pursuing the truth under
this assumption that I will be personally benefited from finding
the truth then what ends up happening is that as
soon as life stops personally benefit you like if your
inquiry into the nature of reality stops to give you
personal payoffs and benefits stops making you feel good about
yourself then you stop pursuing it because you tell yourself
well it must not be the truth then because the
truth is supposed to make me feel good but of
course that's begging the question how do you know the
truth is supposed to make you feel good maybe the
truth suppose to make you feel terrible you don't know
when you start off the inquiry you will only know
if the truth makes you feel good after you found
it not before and of course the trick is that
everybody tells them that they already have the truth I
mean tells themselves that they already have the truth nobody
admits like well I've never found the truth yet so
I don't even know if it's gonna be good or
bad nobody approaches life that way everybody just assumes they
already have the truth which compounds this problem and another
reason that people deny self bias is because they don't
see how being partial or biased produces problems because they're
so myopic they're only looking at the short-term gains so
they think themselves well Leah what's the problem like you
know if if yeah I'm a little bit self biased
towards science maybe okay fine but what's the problem in
science science gives us good stuff it gives us phones
it gives its cars planes rockets all this sort of
stuff comfortable technology so look science is giving us all
these benefits leo what why why question it any further
what's wrong with being a little bit partial that's right
you don't see what's wrong because you're only looking at
the immediate payoffs it's the same problem as shopping with
a credit card you know what's wrong with with shopping
with the credit card well you find out after you
make a lot of purchases months down the road but
not immediately in the short term it seemed great fundamentally
since all points of view are partial and subjective that
is the nature of what a point of view is
they must be selfishly defended against the truth because the
truth transcends all points of view now we're talking about
truth with a capital T now when you begin your
inquiry into the nature of reality to be honest you
don't even know if there is such a thing as
truth you don't know what the truth is it's just
a possibility there's a possibility that there's such a thing
as truth the capital T you don't know though and
you might have to spend years doubting whether there is
such a thing and whether it's worthwhile for you to
pursue but I'm telling you there is such a thing
because I spend in many years pursuing it and I've
found it many times and I understand it pretty well
now so it's there you just don't know what it
is but it turns out to be such a radical
thing that is very very threatening this truth is very
very threatening to all points of view and all worldviews
and so in a sense what all of these different
people are doing with their philosophies and worldviews really is
they're actually constructing elaborate defense mechanisms and schemes of rationalization
to defend against the truth so of course if they're
doing that and the truth is so threatening and dangerous
as I say that it is then why would they
ever admit of all of their defense mechanisms the value
and power of a defense mechanism is in the denial
that you're using these defense mechanisms because if you admitted
it then you'd have to surrender them because you'd be
out of integrity there'd be too much cognitive dissonance see
so the number one trick in deceiving yourself and lying
to others is lying to yourself first because if you
succeed in lying to yourself then you can pull off
the the act that you aren't really lying and it's
true you're not lying because you yourself have tricked yourself
first which makes it easier than for you to trick
others so in the effort to survive and you know
to survive trickery is extremely important for a social species
so for you to survive you have to trick others
but for you to effectively trick others you first have
to trick yourself and so you did and that's the
situation you find yourself in today and from this sprawled
all the different multitude of worldviews that exists on this
planet so it's not that people lie per se it's
that they are blind to how their own mind and
constructs reality towards their own survival people are blind to
this evidence and proof cannot be trusted because they have
been corrupted and co-opted by this entire process by the
self see evidence and proof and logic can only work
if we assume that you're not self biased but we
can't assume that because you're thoroughly self biased you're so
self biased that you deny that your self biased so
what good is evidence and proof and reason have you
noticed that every insane person every crazy cult leader has
a perfectly valid reason and a set of evidence and
logic that he uses to justify his actions every religious
nutcase every scientist who's ever been wrong all the wrong
ones they've all had proof and evidence for why they
were right and yet history prove them to be wrong
so how do you explain that so what good is
your proof in your evidence if you can't rely on
it to accurately get you to the truth the trick
with all this is that it's very easy to see
this problem of self bias in others we're very quick
to point it out in others we're very quick to
point out other people's fallacious arguments and double standards but
it's extremely difficult to see it in yourself when you're
doing it to yourself and that's what really scared me
when I realized all of this it wasn't that I
was scared that other people believed crazy things it was
that I saw that if if all those other people
believed all these crazy things that must mean that I
must believe crazy things as well so what kind of
crazy things do I believe what kind of twisted logic
am I using to uphold my own worldviews that is
that is the the very kernel of skepticism when you
start to take that doubt seriously that's the most serious
doubt that you'll ever consider in your life it's it's
interesting how this works the less conscious one is the
more ego one has the thicker and more distorted that
sense of self that lens of self is through which
reality is perceived the more self biased one is the
more defense mechanisms one will then use to deny that
one is self biased and the more extreme one's defenses
must become in order to be effective see so it's
there's there's a direct connection between all those things so
when you have a very low consciousness person you will
see that this person will have a very thick self
bias and he will have a wide repertoire of defense
mechanisms to deny that he is self biased and it
will be virtually impossible for you to break through to
him through logic through evidence through reason through through emotional
Appeals through anything because that's just the nature of low
consciousness and and if he gets really bad it gets
violent because violence is the ultimate defense mechanism against getting
people to question your views you know if you question
my religion too much I'm going to blow you up
I'm gonna shoot you up so what I concluded early
on in my philosophy days is that all ideology is
self biased all philosophy is self biased every organization is
self biased every country is self bias every political movement
itself biased and then later I found out once I
learn about spirituality is that all spiritual schools are also
self biased and that's an even deeper mindfuck because supposedly
those who are awake are supposed to be the least
soft biased and yet oftentimes even lined people are still
self biased that's how tricky this stuff is very very
tricky and even pragmatism and nihilism our self biased so
you might say this point well Leo you know all
this philosophy business I'm not really interested in this I'm
just a simple ordinary guy I want to like just
go work on my business start my family you know
just do practical stuff so I'm not interested in the
self bias stuff I'm not I don't have any particular
ideologies or pet theories that I want to protect I'm
just interested in being practical yeah that's pragmatism that's yourself
bias in a certain sense pragmatism is the most self
biased position you could have because at least some of
these more theoretical positions there are people are they are
actually at least make pretenses towards caring about the truth
in some abstract sense you know if you're if you're
a a Christian at least you you pretend that you
know the truth if you're a scientist you pretend like
you're pursuing the truth but if you're a pragmatist for
you it's just about whatever serves yourself directly I mean
in a certain sense it's kind of honest at least
you're being honest about your selfishness your just being blatantly
selfish and just caring about what's in it for you
okay fine I understand that but that is self bias
so practical people are self biased as much as theoretical
people are self biased theoretical people are self biased towards
their own theories practical people are our self biased towards
being practical and anti theoretical and nihilists are of course
also self bias you know people who just say ah
[ __ ] it all it's all just nonsense nothing
matters it's just all pointless well that's your self bias
that's the lens of self through which you're seeing the
world it's not true you assume it's true but it's
not true you might wonder well leo but aren't you
just when you're talking about self bias aren't you just
talking about selfishness here what's the difference why aren't you
just calling it selfishness and that's a good that's a
good point you could call self bias selfishness and sometimes
I do but selfishness is a more broad notion selfishness
encompasses a lot of stuff self bias is a little
bit more specific a term and specifically what I'm using
it to highlight is this one aspect of selfishness so
soft bias is a more narrow term that refers to
how the mind frames its intellectual positions you see even
a pragmatist you might say well a pragmatist has no
intellectual positions so how could he be self biased but
he does you see because a pragmatist has an intellectual
position which justifies his pragmatism and tells him why pragmatism
is better than all the other ways of approaching life
so the pragmatist will have some sort of narrative in
his - as well to much theory you know Leo
too much theory rots the mind it's not good for
you you're gonna drive yourself crazy with all this theorizing
and you know this isn't healthy there you go that's
your philosophy that's your pragmatic philosophy or you might say
only all this is nonsense it's not even possible to
know what the truth is so you're just wasting time
that would be sort of up maybe a cynical position
you might call that a cynics position that's yourself bias
you're assuming it's it's it's not worthwhile you're assuming it's
impossible and therefore that's how you see the world and
it becomes true for you doesn't mean it's actually true
it's just true for you from your point of view
now let's bust into my core of this topic which
is let's look at some examples of self bias you
got to really look at examples to see the power
of this concept we've already been talking a little bit
about them but now let's get very specific so the
first example is with dictators and tyrants have you noticed
that a dictator or a tyrant never willingly relinquish his
throne even though he's hurting lots of people it's quite
obvious he's hurting lots of people why doesn't he relinquish
his power I just like go live a comfortable life
I mean supposedly Hitler could have done that Saddam Hussein
Stalin Kim jong-un why are these dictators not doing that
because they don't see themselves as a dictators and tyrants
their self biased they think they're doing good for their
people and you know what they might be I'm not
I'm not saying they aren't but what I am saying
is that they are extremely self biased you know that
Trump also fits into this category very interestingly Trump is
extremely self biased he's he's the poster boy of self
bias self bias on stilts and you know the best
example of which was when all this legal stuff with
the robert muller investigation was happening around Trump there was
this talk of Trump considering pardoning himself that's exactly how
a pirate or a dictator thinks they're so self biased
and they have such a lust for power that to
them the idea of pardoning oneself is totally legitimate because
when you're that selfish when you're that unconscious the notion
that you could be guilty of something but then if
you have you know you could pardon yourself if that
power is available to you that you wouldn't exercise it
because of some shame or some some lack of integrity
or you know yeah some some higher integrity that you
might have this doesn't even cross the mind of a
dictator or retired or an authoritarian like Trump so of
course Trump would part himself if he could of course
he sees nothing wrong with this and of course he
doesn't you you couldn't convince him that there's anything wrong
with this because he's so selfish because he's so short-sighted
all he cares about is his own personal survival so
if that's all you care about and you don't care
about the truth and your version of the truth is
that whatever serves my survival is the truth which is
precisely how Trump behaves he has no other concept of
truth of that then of course you're gonna pardon yourself
and you'll do other nasty and evil things because it's
survival at all costs at that point that's that's the
level of consciousness that he's living in and so are
these other dictators if they didn't have that level of
consciousness they would never have come into power in the
first place because they way they come into power they
don't come into power through through authentic means they come
into power through machinations manipulations scheming exploitation and various other
kinds of corruption and shenanigans sometimes pure violence conquering all
their enemies and all their opponents that's how they come
to power you might say well leo but Hitler a
god elected democratically well I he did but I mean
I I'm not saying he conquered people to get elected
but uh but you have to understand also how much
manipulation exploitation various kinds of other sneaky things went on
behind the scenes to get Hitler elected he didn't really
truly get elected on an honest message and honest campaigning
he was a master of propaganda and various other kinds
of manipulative marketing techniques basically to get himself elected he
played on the various kinds of passions and fears of
the people of the time very much like Trump did
to get elected another example of self bias is colonialism
and what happened with the American natives as the Europeans
moved in to to conquer and exterminate them see the
European attitude towards the natives was a very self biased
one the natives were seen as savages barbarians heathens on
Christians and so because they were not Christians they were
to be converted their traditions were not to be respected
their life wasn't worth as much as a European life
and in fact if they refused to convert then it
was your moral obligation as a good European and a
good Christian to rid the earth of these savages who
were an affront to God because they were heated that's
the attitude you see how itself biased that is it's
it's ridiculous you can go back and read the history
books of the the world views and the beliefs of
these various conquistadors I read one in particular about Magellan
Magellan is it was a bloodthirsty Christian who believed in
converting all heathens he was very vicious to human beings
who were not Christians even to even the Christians he
was pretty brutal too but um but he was just
terrible to indigenous people you know he tried to circumnavigate
the world and as he was doing that he was
encountering all these different native tribes and all these problems
ensued and he was very vicious towards them you know
very dismissive of them basically treated them like animals and
in the end he got butchered by the very animals
that he thought he was dealing with in the Philippines
he got butchered there's still a place in the Philippines
where he can go where there's a belief there's a
statue on a beach where he got blood Lee Mirta
butchered by the Native Filipino people because of just how
vicious and how how self biased he was in their
dealings with him at first the Filipinos were welcome you
know many of these natives tribes they were quite peaceful
they were welcoming you know you think about it these
crazy advanced europeans come from from another part of the
world you know they must have seemed like gods and
aliens to these to these many of these natives in
South America and Indonesia and and in the Philippines but
many of these natives were friendly they traded they even
had sexual relations with with the Europeans who were on
these giant colonial ships but these Europeans were just so
[ __ ] selfish and so ruthless with the way
that they wanted to dominate these natives you know they
they didn't respect any of the natives customs they didn't
expect they didn't respect fair trade agreements they wanted to
rip these guys off so they would do these trade
deals which were very unfair to the natives they would
you know like steal their women and they would disrespect
their their spiritual you know gods and ancestors and all
this and you know they just behaved like [ __
] animals these Europeans did ironically while calling those Native
savages and animals they themselves behave like animals and then
for that they paid some heavy heavy price with their
life most of Magellan's crew was was butchered or just
died of just the long journey it's very fascinating how
that worked and overall this is the whole problem of
colonialism in general you know as the Europeans spread forth
from Europe you know the Spanish the Portuguese the the
Dutch the English hmm all these foking of the French
they had all sorts of encounters with with natives and
basically what happened was bullying the Europeans because they were
generally more advanced and more scheming more egotistical they tried
to bully the natives into submission into serving their survival
needs they tried to enslave them or they try to
do various kind of sneaky unfair trade deals they try
to exterminate them and grab their gold grab their women
bla bla bla bla bla colonialism and herschel colonialism is
no different than bullying at the schoolyard except at a
collective level at a national level and of course why
does this happen self bias it can only happen when
you think that you're superior to those who you're dealing
with if you think the person you're dealing with is
at the same level as you and deserves as much
respect as you and you value their worldview as much
as your own you're not biased towards your own worldview
are you gonna go desecrate and piss on the grave
of their ancestors no are you gonna rape their women
no you're gonna treat their women the way you would
treat your women and of course if you treat your
women badly that's because you have also have a self
bias against the women of your own culture which of
course the Europeans had a problem with as well so
the Europeans didn't just rape the women of of natives
they also raped their own women that's it that's a
that's a problem we're getting to hear down on my
list yeah so you see you see the problem and
then ultimately what happens it gets you killed a lot
of times many slave owners were killed by their slaves
speaking of slavery of course that is the ultimate example
of self bias plantation owners and the worldview they had
in how they treated their slaves totally soft biased they
didn't see the slaves they owned as being human they
saw them as animals which justified in their mind the
ownership and the the cruel treatment of them and what
they put them through see and why do these slave
owners have these philosophies because these philosophies served the slave
owners and how could they maintain these philosophies by being
extremely self biased by coming up with all sorts of
justifications like well I'm a white man and you know
I deserve I deserve to have these these subhuman savages
as you know as my workers because I'm actually doing
something good for them they would be even worse off
without me these sorts of philosophies you know you can
only hold the philosophy or worldly like that if you're
extremely self biased because if you were truly fair and
objective you would say well but what's the difference between
me and them okay the difference in color fine but
don't those people wanna like eat food same as I
do yes don't those people one ally have a family
and make love the way that I do yes don't
those people get tired and sick and don't they suffered
like I do yes okay so then so then why
should I own them and why should I be superior
why should I feel superior to them oh right there's
no reason but to recognize that requires objectivity you see
people take it for granted today that well leo yeah
of course I mean it's it how could someone believe
that a black person is like an animal that that's
that's crazy it's not crazy it actually took a lot
of intellectual development and shedding of self bias to get
to the point where now it's taken for granted that
white and black people are just on the same level
and even still this is not true for many places
around the world even in developed countries even in America
it's still not fully true we still have plenty of
closet racists around and even not closet racists around people
take all this for granted don't take it for granted
shedding of self bias is something that society has been
doing historically for thousands of years since the beginning of
civilization and it's a long arduous process of a lot
of resistance because people don't want to shed their self
biases because it harms their survival so that's totally understandable
of course another example is how humans in general treat
animals human civilization since the dawn of time has treated
animals so badly use them for war you know how
many horses have been killed in in war how many
pack mules have died from exhaustion hauling stones up to
the Egyptian monuments or pyramids or whatever or you know
on the various kinds of expeditions and excavations that have
been happened happening since the dawn of time how many
millions of animals have been butchered and slaughtered to please
the taste buds of humans humans tree animals as completely
disposable this is pure self bias because if you think
about it why would an animal's life be any less
worthwhile than a human's life only because yourself biased that's
the only reason and then of course you have all
sorts of justifications and excuses for why well leo animals
you know they're not really human they don't suffer as
much as humans do they're not really that important we
can just bring more of them who really cares about
them leave how dare you compare an animal to a
human you know these are two totally different things that's
what I'm talking about all of those arguments are completely
skewed towards your own perspective because of course you need
it to come out that you as a human or
on top of the entire food chain that serves you
so well because then you have to think twice about
renting a mule and overworking him to death or killing
a horse in in some battle or you know butchering
some animal for your dinner table so on it's very
inconvenient to admit that animals are as worthwhile as humans
extremely inconvenient see then you can't just be the selfish
[ __ ] that you've been your whole life and
your culture can't continue to be the [ __ ]
that your culture has been its whole life another great
example is corporate lobbying and corruption of course if you
ask a corrupt person are you corrupt what are they
gonna say are they gonna say yes if you ask
a corporate lobbyist are you hurting society with your lobbying
what do you think they're gonna tell you yes no
of course not they believe they're doing good for society
with their corruption the millionaires and the billionaires who who
skew tax policy in their favor who Lobby the government
to get subsidies for their corporations and so forth if
you ask them if they're doing good society they're all
gonna tell you yes that's what they genuinely believe self
bias how about the example of nationalism ethnocentrism of course
racism comes in here to which we've already touched upon
nationalism and ethnocentrism whether it's white nationalism or Nazism German
nationalism and you know nationalism comes in all sorts of
flavours there's a there's a version of nationalism in every
third world country in the Middle East there's nationalism there's
Iranian rationale and there's their Turkish nationalism there's Eastern European
rationals and there's Russian national there's Jewish nationalism there's Filipino
nationalism Chinese Japanese you name it every every country that
has an underdeveloped element has its own form of nationalism
which sometimes flares up and causes a lot of problems
what is nationalism really about it's really about cultural self
bias people favor their own culture thinking that it's superior
to all other cultures without objectively looking at other cultures
without experiencing or exposing themselves to other cultures or even
if they do they do so in a partial manner
or they don't objectively consider the pros and cons and
the the the beauties of other cultures that's what nationalism
boils down to just so fast and you see how
many problems are caused by that the Holocaust was the
result of self bias which brings us to all right-wing
ideologies in general right-wing talk radio all of it Fox
News all of it pretty much this is pure self
bias pure self bias that's what Fox News is spewing
every single day it's just self biases self biased propaganda
machine that's what it is now you might say well
leo but ball are aren't you being biased Leo because
you you're you're ranting against nationalists right the right wing
but what about left-wing ideologies aren't they also self biased
and you're right of course they are but remember there's
degrees of self bias and so what I'm telling you
is that if you are objective and you look at
the degrees of self bias within the left-wing ideology and
right-wing ideology you will find that right-wing ideology is significantly
more soft biased than left-wing ideology that doesn't mean left-wing
ideology is perfect and that it's free of self bias
there's still plenty of it to go around and we
can make many criticisms but remember as I talked about
in my conscious politics series the left and right wing
are not identical they are not just two sides of
the same coin there is a difference in elevation of
their perspective there's actually a difference in their cognitive development
there's a difference in their moral development which is this
is generally not understood by mainstream media and of course
if I point this out and you're a right winger
you will immediately accuse me of being self biased of
course because bias is always relative to one's perspective you
know it would be very problematic for you to admit
that your self biased so you're gonna deny it and
you're gonna accuse me of it tada this is how
the vine works this is the trickery of the mind
and if you're a left winger then you're nodding your
head and you're agreeing with me you're saying yes leo
yes yes yes that's what I've new note all along
the right wingers are so self biased and as you're
doing that you're being self biased you see self bias
is rampant it's rampant its pernicious it's it's invasive it's
like a weed that grows in your garden you can't
stop it you pull it up by it through and
it grows up the next day a few feet away
from where you pull it up it's very tricky people
don't understand what objectivity it means they think that Oh
Leo if you are truly pretending to be objective here
that means you got to treat the right-wing left-wing the
same no that's not objectivity if I did that I
would actually be playing into your self biases I'm not
doing that and of course you're upset at me for
not doing that not playing the game that you want
me to play let's move on to various kinds of
men's rights movements pick up ideology MOG Tao ideology red
pill ideology in cell ideology and generally we can call
all this patriarchy these are various forms of patriarchy or
toxic masculinity as it could be called all of this
is extremely self biased extremely go on to any pick
up forum MOG Tao subreddit some red pill forums some
in cell forum look at the kind of [ __
] they write look at how obnoxious Lee self biased
their entire worldview is basically it's young men who are
frustrated not getting their sexual needs met who are frustrated
with women want to blame women and they develop this
extremely skewed and warped perspective of what women are what
femininity is and how problematic it is for society and
for them because they've wrapped up their own personal sexual
needs and frustrations with women their own inadequacies with women
their own insecurities as a man their own lack of
masculine they've wrapped that selfishness up with the truth and
with the facts and the evidence and the logic and
so what they do is they present science and evidence
and logic and studies and all this to create this
toxic masculine ideology for why you know women are oppressing
men and this sort of stuff and why they are
getting the sex that they need and all the reasons
for why this is happening yeah that's that's the epitome
of self bias the epitome of self bias one of
the things that shocked me the most when I was
in to pick up you know I did pick up
for a while I hung out with a lot of
pickup pickup guys I hung out with a lot of
professional pickup coaches dating coaches some of the world-class ones
some of the ones that you know famous ones you
know world-famous ones and I picked their minds I I
studied with them I took boot camps with them I
know how they think their world view is extremely self
biased and then their students end up getting sucked into
that ideology there's no problem with dating women there's no
problem going to a club and chatting up a girl
and then sleeping with her that night no problem at
all the problem is the toxic masculinity ideology that you
create in order to make that more effective for yourself
that's the real problem that's what goes unaddressed in the
pickup community for example if you want more about that
go check out my episode a rant against the pickup
community where I talk about this and of course that
video is probably one of my top most downvoted videos
it has a huge downvote ratio of course because the
PAS who watch that video do they want to admit
that what they're doing is extremely self biased of course
not because it doesn't serve them because if they admit
that that means that they have to treat women better
that means they can't just go and just obnoxiously exploit
and manipulate women in the way that they want to
get their sexual needs met so by listening to me
that directly conflicts with their number-one objective objective of getting
their dick wet and to a guy who struggles getting
a girl and you know I've been in that situation
before I know how frustrating that can be so I
understand your your desperation and you know that need is
a desperate need that you have if you don't know
how to get your sexual useful field in a healthy
manner yeah you're willing to stoop to any level basically
to get your dick wet that's how sex works sex
is a fundamental human need remember how I told you
about that Judge yeah well you know a lot of
politicians you know how do they how how do a
lot of politicians and judges destroy their careers through inappropriate
sex why is that because sex is a base need
and it's very easy to corrupt yourself when your sexual
needs aren't met because you can be tempted and seduced
so easily and that's also what happens a lot of
times in the Middle East you know a lot of
young men in the Middle East who are sexually frustrated
and then they get caught up in various kinds of
toxic nationalistic Islamist ideologies and then they become terrorists and
suicide bombers and so forth yeah that's why war is
another great example of self bias how could you go
to war unless you were self biased it would be
very hard there are tons of examples of self bias
and war for example when Americans commit war crimes we
deny that we commit war crimes we sweep it under
the rug we are lenient with our soldiers who commit
war crimes because yeah you know after all you know
they were they were fighting for us they were fighting
for the good guys so of course Lea why would
we hold our own war criminals to the same level
as those Nazi barbarians that's pure self bias see if
you didn't have a horse in the race and you
were looking at that situation like if you were an
alien from outer space who was just hovering on his
UFO looking down at the world just of you observing
humans like ants you would realize that the Americans commit
terrible war crimes just as bad as the Vietnamese did
or just as bad as Middle Easterners did or the
Germans did so forth but Americans don't see it there's
a long history of demonization in wartime which I've talked
about in the past I'll give you a few examples
here the Romans versus the Carthaginians were vicious enemies fought
to the death to exterminate each other they were two
different city-states in the Mediterranean you know about the Romans
but you probably don't know much about the Carthaginians they
were mortal enemies they hated each other and they came
up with all sorts of stories about how evil the
other one was and they fought battles against each other
ultimately the Romans exterminated basically the Carthaginians raised their whole
city to the ground but there was vicious demonization of
both sides their rather silly when you look at it
from an objective third-person perspective see you today and I
today we could sit here and we can we can
read the history books about the Romans in the Carthaginians
you know go go google it look it up on
Wikipedia or something you can read that Wikipedia page and
you can see that oh this is this was terrible
vicious self bias on both sides but you couldn't see
it if you were a Roman or if you were
Carthaginian because your survival in your identity was at stake
the only reason you can look at it objectively now
is because it's 2,000 years later and you're neither Roman
nor Carthaginian in fact if you were a modern Roman
you still probably hold some animosity towards Carthaginians probably just
because of your culture that's self bias how about the
Romans versus the barbarians they're barbarians were just the Romans
demonization that term was a Roman term that was invented
to demonize that tribes of Germany of France of you
know Ireland and Great Britain at that time mmm these
were tribal people they were just as as human as
the Romans were sure they might have not had as
big and magnificent of a city as Rome was at
the time but you know the Romans were were no
less barbaric and vicious than the barbarians were you see
so for the barbarians perspective the Romans looked like conquerors
and like Devils and from the Roman perspective the barbarians
seemed like they were you know attacking Rome from outside
and they were trying to destroy civilization both were self
biased how about Athens and Sparta these were two nation
states city states rather in ancient Greece who were also
mortal enemies and who went to war many times against
each other demonized each other had different lifestyles different cultures
read about that the Nazis during World War two were
viciously demonized by the Americans literally painted with fangs and
horns and Devils tails the Japanese and the Chinese were
called Japs and Xinxin were also demonized and painted with
horns and so forth by the Americans during World War
two during Vietnam and so forth and we do today
with Islam America does this with Muslims so you see
how that works how about the example of criminals criminals
if you haven't noticed very often excuse their own crimes
they don't see their own crimes as crimes they don't
see themselves criminals especially many white-collar criminals self bias legal
disputes are a great example of self bias because what
happens in a courtroom you have a prosecuting attorney and
a defense attorney they come in there and they just
they only argue for their side they only argue for
their client their client could be guilty of murder and
the defense attorney will still argue for why the guy
didn't commit murder because the defense attorney he's getting paid
to defend that client he's not getting paid for truth
now ideally the judge is supposed to be of the
objective one the impartial one who's gonna adjudicate or if
not the judge than the jury but but the lawyers
themselves are totally Southwest shamelessly self biased and that's why
people hate lawyers now of course in truth there are
many good lawyers out there who could fight for good
causes and the legal system is very important because you
have to understand that without the legal system as bad
as the legal system might be it's even worse when
there is no legal system because then people just grab
their knives and swords and guns and go for each
other for each other's throats it children how about negotiations
when you're negotiating somebody like your employer for a salary
raise or you're in the negotiating a business deal with
some business partner or you're negotiating for a car that
you want to buy what's going on in negotiation is
the truth being served in a negotiation of course not
everybody knows that in a negotiation both sides are bullshitting
as much as humanly possible to justify why they should
get the better end of the deal and they are
trying to screw the other side isn't that how a
negotiation works of course self bias and why because these
negotiations are usually directly related to your survival money cash
you know a giant negotiation where millions of dollars at
stake lots of people's salaries are at stake which means
lots of people's survivals are at stake when you're negotiating
for your car you know you worked hard for that
money so for you saving an extra thousand dollars it's
a big deal survival you don't care about what's actually
fair in that situation you don't care about like how
much does the dealer earn when you're negotiate with you
don't think about the dealer's children like you don't ask
yourself like well maybe I should be a little bit
nicer to the dealer because you know he's not gonna
earn enough on this car that his children will go
hungry you don't give a [ __ ] about his
children you just want your car and you want to
save as much as possible and the dealer of course
is playing that same game from the opposite side all
religion is a amazing example of self bias every religion
thinks it's the best every religion has an excuse for
an irrational logic and evidence and proof for why it's
the one true one the best one the one that
you should believe why you should ignore all the other
ones and the Catholic Church is probably the best example
this you know if you ask the Catholic Church are
you guys harming children they will say of course not
Lia we would never harm children that goes directly against
everything the Catholic Church believes of course of course self
bias see if you're a Catholic priest you can't admit
that you're part of an organization that abuses children on
a systemic massive level around the whole law you can't
admit that you can't live with that especially because the
church has filled your mind with all these ideas of
how how godly you are and how special the church
is and how Christ can do no wrong and how
God is beautiful and good and moral and all this
and how your you're a Messenger of God your representative
of God your trying to be saintly in all this
this just makes it even worse because now you need
to ratchet up your defense mechanisms threefold to deal with
that cognitive dissonance with the reality of what goes on
in the Catholic Church self bias but it doesn't stop
with religion it also this self bias problem is present
within all spiritual schools as well all mystical schools even
the ones that you would think are good like Zen
Buddhism yoga various schools of yoga Sufism what else is
there Jainism you know these are some of the better
spiritual schools or just advisor neo-advaita even just teachers on
their own who are not affiliated with any tradition there
they're all self biased they all think their system is
the best they all have justifications and reasons for why
they're the most enlightened and others aren't why their enlightenment
is its complete by others or not every even even
just within yoga there's like a thousand different schools of
yoga and each one thinks that it's the best of
the original the truest the most enlightening the most beneficial
the one that helps the most people whatever so fast
cults are all extremely self biased if you take any
cult that has ever existed in all human history and
you go to his leader to the cults leader and
you ask them are you a cult they'll look at
you with a straight face and they'll say of course
not we're good we're not a cult what are you
talking about we're helping people to see the truth to
wake up we're improving their lives we're not a cult
self bias partisanship partisanship is a beautiful example of self
bias what are partisans partisans aren't people who take parts
who take sides they divide reality into two and then
they take one part one side at the expense of
the other side and then that brings us to academia
and professional science many people are under the illusion that
these guys are supposed to be immune to self bias
but they aren't I could be me in professional science
is extremely self biased and you might wonder well how
how telling me how is science self biased well I'll
tell you how science is self biased because it's committed
to quantifying all of reality to modern science if a
thing can't be quantified it doesn't exist and you might
tell a scientist but what about this thing here which
can't be quantified but clearly it exists the scientist looks
at and says well but how do i quantify that
I can't quantify it so it must not exist but
look it exists yeah but I can't quantify it so
doesn't see they don't get it they don't get what
they're doing science is biased towards mysticism I mean biased
against mysticism bias against spirituality biased against the paranormal biased
against evidence of the paranormal there's there's tons of valid
evidence about the paranormal that mainstream sciences is totally in
denial about and biased against yeah mmm that's very problematic
now I'm not saying the science is doomed you know
one of the managers of science is that it does
involve and there of course are scientists who study the
paranormal and they do good research and all this so
there are a few cutting-edge scientists who are visionaries but
I'm talking about mainstream science for the most part which
is still very materialistic and very closed-minded in certain ways
science has makes many ungrounded epistemic and metaphysical assumptions that
it's in denial about that it refuses to question the
self bias of science is what produces paradigms and paradigm
lock which it was famously talked about by by Thomas
Kuhn a philosopher of science and historian of science the
groundbreaking work that's one of the most important scientific works
of the 20th century was Thomas Kuhns book about scientific
revolutions and paradigms that book by the way is on
my book let's go check that out atheism rationalism materialism
and reductionism these are self biased how is reductionism self
biased well a reductionist a reductionist assumes that you could
take all phenomena and reduce it down to just molecules
and atoms and physics and then when you point out
to him well here's a phenomena that you can't reduce
to atoms and physics he will say that's not a
real phenomenon then because all phenomenon can be reduced to
atoms and physics but that's begging the question you don't
know that all phenomena can be reduced to atoms and
fitness and of course in truth they can't that's a
that's a silly reductionist dogma another great example of south
bias is favoring your own family and friends over other
people over strangers there's no reason why your family is
more important than a stranger other than your self bias
and then a great example that is nepotism nepotism is
when you put your own family into positions of power
even though they haven't earned it or deserved it simply
because you have a position of power so it's like
if I'm the king then I get to appoint my
my sons and daughters as the as the the deputies
the Dukes and and so forth of various kinds of
departments of the government this is extremely common in developing
countries third-world countries all around the world nepotism is rampant
in America and in Europe nepotism has been mostly stamped
out of course with the exception of of Trump now
you know Trump comes back trumps back into power and
so he as you've noticed he has no problem with
nepotism putting his incompetent children into positions of power over
things that they shouldn't be managing objectively speaking his children
are clueless about the things that they're engaged in there
there are senators Middle Eastern negotiations with Israelis and Palestinians
and all this was a clueless no experience in this
a high-quality leader would come in there and would realize
that well you know I love my children but I'm
not going to sacrifice the well-being of the country by
putting them into positions that they're not qualify for let
me get an expert who's actually knowledgeable about you know
Middle Eastern policy to negotiate with the Israelis and Palestinians
rather than putting some incompetent a son-in-law in charge that's
nepotism and that's exactly how many tires and dictators work
when a tyrant comes into power he puts his whole
family into all the top positions because he can't trust
anyone but his family that's how mob bosses work -
that's it of course exactly Trump's modus operandi that's how
he's where he's run his whole business his whole life
is in this way because that's the level of consciousness
that he's at extremely selfish extremely soft biased doesn't even
think that there's a problem with this nepotism but of
course nepotism is a massive corruption of government it's a
huge problem that Europe had to work through you know
during the the French Revolution and all through all the
struggles that Europe has faced over the last let's say
500 years a lot of it involved nepotism and they
had to pass laws against nepotism remove it and of
course when that tradition came to America we also passed
laws against nepotism now you might say well leo but
what about Hillary Clinton wasn't she just like another line
in the in the in the lineage of the Clintons
and so if she won the election that would also
Vinh nepotism yeah that's a problem too that's a problem
too but what I'm telling you is that Trump's nepotism
is worse and the reason Trump's nepotism is worse is
because Hillary Clinton actually is conscious and developed enough that
she has a sense of the impropriety of nepotism more
so than Trump I'm not saying she's perfect but she
is more conscious than Trump if you can't see that
you're so biased now you know the problem though is
that if you can't see that you're gonna call me
self biased for calling out yourself bias of course you
will that's how that's how you must act to maintain
yourself bias romantic relationships are another great example of self
bias most relationships are destroyed by self bias when you're
arguing with your spouse girlfriend or boyfriend when they're cheating
on you or when you're cheating on them when you
are having disputes what is that about self bias you're
not actually treating that relationship in a fair manner or
you actually care about the needs of the other person
most relationships you're trying to get your needs met the
other person is trying to get their needs met and
it's just this is luck in negotiations transactional that's what
most relationships boil down to and of course that's why
most relationships and most marriages fail self bias gerrymandering is
a beautiful and disgusting example of self bias all at
the same time pure self bias the people in power
want to redraw the district lines in order to fail
it favored themselves they don't care about the truth they
don't care about maintaining one-person one-vote they don't care about
honoring the the will of the people they just want
to maximize their party's chances at winning debates are an
example of self bias the reason debates are so useless
and the reason that I don't really engage in debates
sometimes people ask me Leo winter you need bait that
person or this person why aren't you out there talking
with people on podcasts and videos and debating with them
and all this because debates serve self bias why would
I want to waste my time doing that in a
debate it's just like a lawyer in a courtroom everybody's
just arguing for their own position the truth is lost
nobody cares about the truth you're just arguing for your
own biases that's all the debate is so mostly debates
are a waste of time so if you're frustrated with
watching debates that's why because the truth is never addressed
mostly you're just reinforcing your own biases when you're watching
a debate whoever is most aligned with your bias is
the one you're gonna say won the debate because you're
not objective the Israelis and the Palestinians this is a
huge self biased problem especially on the Israeli side the
Israelis are viciously self biased with the encroachment that they're
doing you know occupying your eStore territories within Palestine and
they're doing this very deliberately it's a deliberate strategy that
they've been executing for the last 30 or 40 years
I don't know how many years it's been with these
Israeli settlements but they're doing it and they're doing it
just shamelessly because it serves them because when you believe
it Israelis are the chosen people and that they are
the ones who are supposed to be in charge of
that land the Palestine area the land the holy land
of Christ and and Moses and all this yeah you're
gonna be self biased and of course the evangelicals support
the Israelis that's why America supports Israel so much in
this very self biased way and it leads to unfairness
it's unfair to the Palestinians who have been allocated those
territories in that land bye-bye UN treaties and so forth
and past agreements also I want to point out to
you as we're talking about these examples it's not always
giant issues that involves self bias a lot of times
self bias you know many of these examples I'm talking
about these are macro examples of countries nations races being
self biased but it happens in the micro level every
single day for you like have you ever parked at
a Walmart or something you go go shopping and then
you see some other guy there he parked such a
terrible manner that he's like taking up to two parking
spots and you get pissed off at this guy you
started judging this guy you like how dare this guy
look look at how we consider a he's such a
bastard the way he parked but that a month later
your child is sick or your dog is sick so
you're rushing to Walmart to buy some medicine for them
and then you park your car terribly just like that
guy did and when you're coming back from the store
you see you're terribly parked car and you realize oh
[ __ ] and that's a that's a interesting moment
of a rude awakening but of course a lot of
people will rationalize it to themselves you actually notice your
mind doing this I noticed this sometimes I mind doing
this is I help with excuses from like oh well
but but i but I needed this medicine my dog
is sick so I needed the medicine so of course
I was in a rush in all this and so
it's understandable why I would Park this way or just
like I'm driving a rented car I don't have the
feel for this car yet so of course I'm gonna
knock in a park it quite as well as I
would park my normal car yeah but you see you
didn't offer that same excuse and that same leeway to
the guy that you were judging and angry at a
month ago for his bad parking job what if his
child was sick what if he was in a rush
what if he was driving a rented car you don't
know you didn't care that's how judgment and criticism work
in general they're extremely self biased criticism is never almost
never objective Western culture as a whole is extremely self
biased how well it's called American exceptionalism especially in America
here talking about American culture but what's your culture overall
is rationality over emotion analysis over synthesis and holism individualism
over collectivism the masculine epistemology versus the feminine materialism over
spirituality science over emotions and feelings and human well-being and
happiness money and greed over human well-being and happiness and
health that's Western culture in nutshell those are all the
various self biases you know speaking of masculine versus feminine
epistemology you know that the pistil mala G actually comes
in in these two different flavors masculine and feminine the
last two thousand years of Western culture have mostly been
feminine epistemology from I mean sorry masculine masculine epistemology of
course from-from masculine philosophers because most philosophers in Western culture
were male and it was only recently like in the
last seventy years that feminist philosophers have emerged and feminist
epistemologists have emerged and they have rethought how epistemology works
and they've made some important critiques books have been written
about how one's theory of knowledge and even one's way
of knowing the world is actually skewed and distorted by
whether you're masculine or feminine or feminine and there's different
approaches and that different epistemologies lead to different results and
different conclusions about reality that's that's an important consideration that
the feminists have introduced into Western philosophy that's important don't
dismiss that of course another example is the u.s. foreign
policy again American exceptionalism this is extremely self biased the
way that America tries to bully other nations tries to
manipulate them interfere with their elections tries to extract resources
tries to create favorable business environments in the Middle East
or in South America or elsewhere through sometimes through their
diplomatic leverage sometimes through military intervention sometimes through threats of
war deposing democratically elected governments overseas this is self bias
you could only have this kind of foreign policy if
you were biased towards your own nation if you actually
believe that other nations has have equal sovereignty and deserve
their own autonomy and deserve their own democracies you couldn't
have the kind of foreign policy that has existed for
the last seven years in America I also want to
point out as an example many internet intellectuals that are
popular these days online on YouTube and elsewhere there are
a lot of these sort of pseudo intellectuals that masquerade
as though they are defenders of truth across the internet
which are just hopelessly self biased obnoxiously self biased cartoonishly
self biased I'm talking about people like Jordan Peterson ben
shapiro stefan molyneux dave rubin sam harris neil degrasse tyson
even Christopher Hitchens Daniel Dennett Lawrence Krauss Bill Nye even
various kinds of online gurus Indian gurus that you see
that are popular on youtube today yeah most of these
guys are extremely self biased and they have no idea
what they're doing at the metal level they have no
idea what they're doing so be very careful in fact
most intellectuals of any kind are gonna be very soft
biased because this this notion that I'm teaching you of
self buys is this is cutting-edge stuff like it's not
talked about almost anywhere almost nobody knows about this stuff
and for a good reason because nobody wants to know
about this stuff because it's not in their agenda and
it's not in their favor it doesn't serve their survival
to know about this stuff humanity as a whole is
deeply self biased I call it the human species bias
we believe were the best species the smartest species the
most advanced species the most important species the only species
that actually counts that matters the only one that deserves
rights the only one that that we need to care
about the suffering of the only one whose epistemology in
science is the best and correct we don't even consider
the epistemologies of animals that's how biased humanity is so
that's the list of examples of course there's plenty more
but that'll do it for now let me share a
list with you now of related terms to the term
self bias so self bias is often synonymous with selfishness
conflict of interest hypocrisy double standards confirmation bias cherry-picking justification
rationalization partiality or just be partial paradigm lock as I've
talked about the past devilry mess-up talked about the past
intellectual dishonesty survival as I talked about in the past
and self-deception as I've talked about in the past I
have episodes on many of these I've episodes on devilry
I have episodes on survival I have so it's selfishness
I have episodes on self-deception these are all closely related
ideas but they're also fine distinctions we can make between
these and because it's such an important topic that's why
I shoot videos from different angles to cover this from
different angles now you might wonder in the end like
leah why should I be objective why why what's in
it for me to be objective well hopefully some of
the examples I mentioned up above have have gotten you
to start to see some of the problems see there's
some nasty things I mentioned up above that happened from
self bias but but let's let's reiterate that let's make
it more clear so why is self bias a problem
well even even before I get I get to that
list look can you see how even just asking what's
in it for me why should I be objective how
already how dysfunctional that is already how self bias that
is because you're asking me to frame this entire conversation
in such a way that it serves your stupid petty
little ego as if your ego is the most important
and only thing in the universe as if that could
be the only consideration that a living being could have
is its own survival see you see the problem you're
already deeply self past so if you're asking what's in
it for me you're you're already deeply deluded and you're
not gonna understand what I'm saying here you need to
be open to an attitude towards life where it's not
about you it's not about what's in it for me
in a sense I don't even want to play your
game I don't even want to explain to you why
you should worry about self bias but I will anyways
I will frame it for you in a selfish manner
because the only thing you understand is selfishness so that's
why I'll frame it for you though that way but
understand that this is not gonna be enough you're gonna
need to go beyond your selfishness to really understand me
but anyways here it is selfishly the reason you should
have worried about self bias is because it precludes self-reflection
and questioning of deep fundamental assumptions these deep fundamental assumptions
that you don't question constitute your paradigm which then lead
to a distorted view of the world a distorted view
of the world means that you're gonna [ __ ]
things up badly when you're trying to manipulate systems in
the world because you don't understand them they're gonna backfire
on you in catastrophic ways leading to of course death
and suffering is that a good enough reason for you
to care about self bias at least a paradigm lock
it closes down the mind it leads to cultural and
tolerance at least to violence hatred anger judgment and demonization
of other humans and even nonhumans leads to oppression abuse
of power exploitation enslavement criminality leads to corruption leads to
nepotism leads to lying in propaganda it precludes and retards
the evolution of society it creates unfairness and inequality makes
healthy relationships virtually impossible makes genuine communication virtually impossible between
two beings it precludes responsibility taking which is a core
principle of self-improvement and spirituality it creates evil what you
consider evil you see so if you don't care about
self bias then you have no right to complain about
evil in the world because evil is the result of
self bias we are discussing the mechanics of evil here
so don't be perplexed and confused and asking naive question
I Kolya why does evil exist why do bad things
happen to good people self [ __ ] bias that's
why because everyone is as selfish as you and nobody
cares about that's why and ultimately the greatest tragedy of
self bias is that it precludes the discovery of truth
absolute truth of the capital t it precludes the discovery
of God you can't discover God if you're too self
biased have you ever wondered why people are such monsters
and Devils it's not that there are monsters and devils
they're just blind to their self biases as Jesus said
forgive them father for they know not what they do
have you ever noticed how you just really don't give
a [ __ ] about other people's problems have you
noticed this I want you to notice this it's amazing
really somebody on TV could have lost their child or
their parent and yours clicking through the channels and you
watch it and you see it and you're like okay
and then yeah it's kind of bad and you just
kind of move on but for that person to lose
their child or their parent this is a huge massive
ordeal a massive problem huge suffering grief torture the depths
of hell for this person for weeks for months for
years they're coping with this just struggling with this for
you nothing nothing not even not even a second not
even a second of suffering or pain for you why
why why is it such a big problem for them
but not for you because a problem isn't a problem
unless it affects you that's your attitude towards life that's
how self biased you are problems don't even exist for
you unless they affect you that's what a problem is
yeah you just don't care you don't care even if
your mom has a problem a lot of times you
just don't care why not cuz it doesn't serve you
to care notice that notice how viciously self biased you
are but then when you have that same problem or
now all the sudden you care all now it's a
giant problem now it's a huge drama it's a huge
ordeal oh my god oh my god I need help
Leo please help me yeah only when it affects you
do you care that's the level of consciousness that you're
at right now but I want you to know that
there are higher levels of consciousness where you can care
even when something doesn't directly affect you have you noticed
how partial people are to their own cultures it's crazy
it's it's it's almost cartoonish it's ridiculous when you zoom
out and take a look at how people value their
culture and think that their culture is superior that their
culture is the best their cuisine is the best their
people are the best their races the bet their nationality
is the best their cultures come up with the best
inventions the best science the best spirituality the best yoga
the best this the best the books the movies the
whatever the poems the stories the language is the best
self eyes blind self bias and perhaps the starkest example
of self bias is the way that humans treat death
and suffering humans just do not care about the death
and suffering of other species almost not at all a
few advanced humans do but most humans not at all
and certainly not for most of human history why not
because it didn't serve us to care but why should
it matter why should there be a difference between the
death of a human and an ant you know some
celebrity dies in the news some big musician or movie
star or whatever and people are all sad about it
they type about it on the on the forums on
social media and all boo-hoo-hoo and how tragic how terrible
it is you know the New York Times writes a
big post about it you know Time magazine puts the
picture of their face everywhere you see it on the
at the supermarket shelves you see everybody's you know eulogizing
how great this person was yada yada yada when a
bird dies a pigeon outside in your neighborhood what does
anybody care does they get splattered all over the evening
news no nobody gives a [ __ ] but what's
the difference is there a difference is there really a
difference if you were truly objective if you were like
an alien from outer space on a sitting on a
UFO just looking down with your telescope would there be
any difference of course not of course not the value
of the life of bird is no less than the
value of a life of some celebrity and yet look
how differently we treat them why because we're so goddamn
partial and unobjective so if you really want to have
the proper perspective a high elevation perspective of the whole
universe you need to step outside of all this crap
all this partial stuff that you're doing and you need
to start to become objective here's a key insight I
want you to remember for the rest of your life
how bias works the devil sees objectivity and impartiality as
evil as bias and as disloyalty by devil I mean
a selfish person to understand what I mean by devil
go see my episode what is the devil search warrant
so the devil and what makes him a devil is
that he will project his own bias onto objective and
selfless people - a devil the worst possible sin is
putting truth above loyalty to some to himself and so
Devils will absolutely Gaslight you as you're trying to be
objective and impartial don't expect people to appreciate or validate
your objectivity and impartiality they will actually do the opposite
see when you point out the self biases of other
people they will get deeply offended by it and deeply
hurt and they will lash out at you so that's
why for example conservatives perceive calling out evils of the
government as disloyalty because many conservatives don't wanna admit for
example that the US government commits war crimes that's why
many white supremacists complain about reverse racism because when you
call out legitimate racism in society the people who are
participating in the racism they need some defense mechanisms so
what they do is they project their own bias back
on to you by calling you a reverse racist white
genocide and all this sort of stuff the Catholic Church
perceives critiques of the church as the work of the
devil will perceive a critique of science and materialism as
pseudoscience mysticism and anti science so I have rendered many
critiques of science in the past and oftentimes people listen
to me and they say oh well then Leo must
be anti science no I'm not anti science I love
science I'm actually a true defender of science but of
course it's precisely because I am a true defender of
science and I'm pointing out the corruptions of science in
the same way that if I was pointing out the
corruptions of the Catholic Church I would be demonized for
it of course of course that's how devilry works because
the devil is not aware of his own self bias
he projects it onto you so if you have gripes
with me about being self bias be careful watch out
maybe you're a devil maybe you need to look within
to find your own biases first before you go complaining
about mine if you are going to become a selfless
conscious loving objective unbiased person which is the point of
this work you will be attacked and you will be
attacked precisely on the following terms you will be attacked
for being selfish egotistical narcissistic amoral subjective biased unscientific irrational
disloyal to the human race and to your country and
you will be called evil and you will be called
the devil so all of the things that you are
precisely working to correct within yourself as you're spiritually purifying
yourself you will be called all of those things by
other devils who are not doing this work so just
keep that in mind be ready for that I'm telling
you all this so you're ready for it this is
what happened with Socrates with Jesus with Buddha with maja
with Mahatma Gandhi with Martin Luther King it's happening right
now with Bernie Sanders for example if you seek to
significantly uplift society you will be demonized this is a
general rule of human society and human nature because what's
involved with uplifting society is undoing selfishness and self bias
but the ego hates with itself biases are pointed out
so of course the ego is going to lash out
and project because the ego wants to rig the game
for its own advantage so the thing the ego hates
the most is those people those whistleblowers who point out
the rigging of the game that the ego is doing
see the ego treats this as the worst and greatest
threat the greatest disloyalty what the ego wants is the
ego wants compatriots who are going to be loyal conspirators
in this conspiracy of self deception and self bias doesn't
just work alone by itself soft bias is compounded by
conformity it's very hard to be soft biased all by
yourself as an individual it's much easier when you have
a bunch of other people who aren't as self biased
as you so that all of us can come together
and we can be self biased as a group you
know because if I'm viciously racist yeah it's gonna be
hard for me to maintain that but if I can
be viciously racist and I can gather a social media
group of ten thousand other vicious racists and then we
can come up with a story about how it's the
other people who are actually reverse racists against us then
we can convince ourselves that we don't actually have a
self bias and that turns out to be one of
the core functions of human groups is to normalize self
bias because in a group we can create a story
that creates a collective denial of our shameless self biases
and that's exactly what certain organizations for example Fox News
is doing that is the whole structure of Fox News
the people who work there don't even understand that they're
doing this because they are all surrounded by others who
are asked self biased as them and they're spewing out
this propaganda and the value this propaganda has to people
who watch fox news is that of course they themselves
are as self biased as the people on fox news
and this is a great benefit because it builds a
collection of millions of people who can be self biased
together you can be a devil together collective devilry and
as we do this collective devilry we can convince ourselves
that were actually angels and that's how the devil really
does is work the devil doesn't do his work individually
the devil does most of his work collectively through individuals
collectively so you might be wondering Malia what's the alternative
to self bias its impartiality and objectivity I'll give you
two examples from art history actually you know I was
a student of art history really love art history passionate
about it ever since high school and there are two
paintings that that I always found admirable because of the
objectivity that they demonstrated these are two paintings by French
painter neoclassical painter Jacques lui dahveed maybe you've seen these
before these are pretty famous especially the first one I'm
gonna show you which is called the death of Socrates
now I don't know how much you know about Socrates
I'll just tell you the story here in brief but
Socrates were put on trial by the people of Athens
for corrupting the minds of the youth that was the
official charge against him he was tried and ultimately he
was convicted he was actually given a chance to repent
I think he was given a chance to change his
ways to admit that he did wrong and to I
guess maybe excommunicate himself or something like that but Socrates
was too proud and he had too much integrity and
basically he said that no I will I will take
my punishment because Socrates believed in the rule of law
so he said you know whatever you guys decide should
be my punishment I will take it because that's how
much I believe in truth and the rule of law
and so he was sentenced to death he was sentenced
to drink a cup of Hemlock I believe it was
some kind of poison and so this image that you
see here this this piece called the death of Socrates
by Jacques Louie de vide is the moment right before
Socrates drinks the hemlock so this is a powerful scene
powerful image which demonstrates the integrity and the objectivity and
impartiality of Socrates he calmly takes his punishment drinks the
hemlock of his own will you know doesn't refuse he
they don't have to force him to drink it or
anything and then and I'm just paraphrasing here but I
believe in his last moments you know after he drank
the hemlock he just kind of sat there on the
bed he walked around a little bit he felt the
poison kicking in within a few minutes starting to you
know affect him disable his motor functions and so forth
and he just you know he talked to the people
there and he just explained what was happening to them
and he was she was kind of interested and curious
about the whole thing and people asked him well aren't
you afraid to die and he would say why would
I be afraid to die but because I don't even
know what death is you know if I had died
and I knew the death was terrible then I would
be you know it would be reasonable for me to
be fearful of death but since since none of us
have experienced death what if death is the greatest thing
there is so I shouldn't fear death it's unreasonable it's
irrational to fear death and he lived up to those
words and so that shows you what true objectivity impart
reality and integrity really means imagine being able to be
that objective in real life see you can see that
this is an extraordinary psyche an extraordinary being behaves this
way not your average guy and then the second painting
is also by Jacques lui de vide and it's called
the lictors bring to Brutus the bodies of his sons
so this is uh this is also an image from
ancient Rome so Brutus was one of the founders of
the Roman Republic and he really believed in the Republic
and democratic rule and so forth against tyranny and emperors
and so when he discovered that his own sons were
conspiring to bring a tyrant and a monarch to power
to overthrow the Republic he had the tough decision to
make of sentencings sentencing his own sons to death and
so because he believed in the Republic so much he
believed in the principles of it he had high integrity
he sacrificed his own sons committed them to death and
now in this scene the you could see in the
corner there off to the side the bodies are brought
being brought into him and he's sitting there you know
dealing with the magnitude of his decision of having to
choose the Republic over his own sons which shows you
the power of of integrity and what it takes to
be able to make a decision like that now you
could contrast that for example with Trump if Trump discovered
that one of his sons or his son in laws
or his relatives was engaged in some sort of corrupt
activity in the government would he put them to death
what he tried them as a traitors would he care
at all or would he hide their corruption you probably
know the answer to that question so as you can
see truly impartial people are very rare these are the
kinds of people we need more of this is the
kind of person that you need to be if you're
doing this work you'll notice that objectivity and impartiality is
not taught in school or in university that's not by
accident that's because those who are in charge what their
biases reinforced so why would they teach you in partiality
and objectivity if school or science or university taught you
true objectivity and impartiality it would undermine itself and it
would destroy that institution from within so of course it's
not in their agenda to teach you luckily we're different
here with extra lines that orange now you might wonder
but Leo what about your self biases our choose self
bias it seems like you're sitting up here judging everybody
else condemning everybody else but you're a hypocrite what you
need to understand about self bias this whole topic is
that it's not about judging or condemning others it's very
easy to condemn others for self bias it's really about
getting you to self-reflect I'm not condemning you I understand
where you're at because I've been where you're at and
to a certain degree I still am where you're at
I do have self biases the difference is that I've
been observing and studying myself biases for the last 20
years and you probably haven't that's the difference it's not
that I am perfect and then I don't have a
single self bias it's that I'm more aware of my
self biases than most people and that makes me more
aware of the self biases of other people as well
and this helps me to avoid various kinds of self-deception
again don't misunderstand me I'm not perfect I am always
vulnerable to self-deception itself bias and therefore I have to
be vigilant all the time so the lesson here is
that you must vigilant and I comport with that lesson
I am trying to be vigilant now you're not always
gonna be perfect in your vigilance precisely because my point
is that the self biases are extremely tricky you might
be able to spot a self bias within me that
I'm not able to spot yet within myself but I
probably will over time because I'm always on the hunt
for more self biases and that's what my growth process
has been over the last 20 years of course it's
hard for you guys to see it how much my
positions have changed on things you know when I started
out I was an atheist when I sorted out I
was all on board with science it took me a
lot of questioning of my own self biases to see
the limitations of science and atheism and materialism and reductionism
and realism and many other philosophies and ideologies of pick
up you know I was in pick up and I
didn't see the self biases of pick up until I
got more aware and then I became more conscious of
self biases in my intimate relationships self biases within the
way I interact with my family and friends self biases
with how I run actualize Org over time I've been
spotting more and more of those so this is a
never-ending project this is not something you're just you watch
one video you go oh yeah I can understand self
bias then you're done no this is your vigilant for
the rest your life as I have to be and
even as you have awakenings and enlightenment you're still not
immune to self bias in fact in certain ways you're
open to even further self biased even deeper levels of
self bias because now that you're awake you think that
you've you understand it all which you probably don't but
leo isn't it what you're talking about here isn't this
relativism isn't this post-modernism is just nihilism actually no this
goes way deeper than just relativism and post-modernism actually post-modernism
is self biased it took me quite a while to
realize the self bias as a post-modernism and if relativism
a lot of people get stuck there especially stage green
people but leo is it really possible to ever be
objective isn't that there's just a pipe dream well that's
the best the really interesting bit is that it's possible
to access the absolute it actually is possible believe it
or not to access absolute truth and absolute understanding of
reality that is possible but not using conventional means not
using science and not using any of the kind of
worldviews or philosophies that we've talked about in this episode
and you might wonder well how is that possible how
could it be possible to be objective when Leo everything
is so subjective and you're always looking through human perception
well believe it or not when you go deep enough
you can actually deconstruct you in perception and you can
deconstruct human subjectivity and what you'll end up with is
the absolute and that's what Awakening is about but I
can't go into too much depth on that here I've
talked about it in the past another objection is but
Leo how do I know when I'm truly being unbiased
is there some metric some rule of thumb and the
answer is no there's not that's the whole trick to
it if there was a simple metrical rule of thumb
if you could just quantify it in some way if
you could just lay out some Ten Commandments that you
need to follow to be forever unbiased in your life
to avoid self-deception well then we wouldn't be having this
talk it would be easy I would just give you
the ten rules the ten commandments you would follow them
and everything would be peachy but of course it doesn't
work this way the whole point is that you never
know when you're gonna deceive yourself so you always have
to be vigilant I wish I could just tell you
that all just take this psychedelic and you will forever
be unbiased but it doesn't work that way and even
if you do yoga or meditation you can still be
biased so there's no foolproof method it takes consciousness it
takes constant vigilance it takes energy it's not easy so
what's the solution to self bias it's this first of
all start noticing your self biases it all starts there
notice the large ones notice the smallest catch yourself applying
double standards to how you justify your own actions and
beliefs stop trusting in your own justifications stop favoring your
own interests above all other interests drop manipulations and schemes
to get your own way at any cost try to
have integrity in your dealings with people try to have
integrity in your intellectual positions stop asking but what's in
it for me because if you're always asking but what's
in it for me that's leading you down the road
of self bias that's a self biased question cultivate a
genuine desire for the truth regardless of the cost regardless
of how it makes you feel make it a top
value a top priority above even your own survival and
just read more and study divergent points of view this
goes a very long way towards opening your mind and
helping you to see your own self biases when you
lock yourself into a propaganda bubble like Fox News or
a liberal one you know there are also liberal propaganda
bubbles that you can lock yourself into through YouTube or
other it becomes incestuous your world you become so incestuous
because you're always just interacting with others who have the
same worldview and you're not getting diverse perspectives from outsiders
which is exactly what you need you need this whether
you're running a business or you're having family trouble you
need outside perspectives if you aren't yet able to drop
a self bias at least have the courage to admit
that your self biased see there's there's two stages here
first you have to notice that yourself biased and then
admit it to yourself and to others potentially and then
the second step is you have to go beyond they
actually let it go let go of the self bias
like for example you might admit that yeah leo you
know what I favor white people over black people or
you know i favor European cuisine over Asian cuisine you
might admit that to yourself then you might go one
step further and admit that publicly I mean that's your
family admit that to your friends whatever that you know
that takes courage takes honesty but then there's one step
further where you actually have to surrender that position and
that's where it's really difficult because you feel uncomfortable you
know maybe make more friends with people from different cultures
or maybe go travel to countries with cuisine that you're
not comfortable in that's the actual step you take to
let go of that self bias see and then do
that intellectually do that if you're a conservative do that
if you're a liberal do that if you're a nihilist
do that if you're a materialist or whatever now you
might say Oh Leo but but shouldn't shouldn't you do
that Leo shouldn't you do that with with non-duality if
you're gonna if you're gonna like eat your own dog
food here and follow your advice shouldn't you question non-duality
and shouldn't you question god no because that's the absolute
non-duality is not a soft bias sorry but I know
that doesn't seem fair to you because you want non-duality
to be a self bias but non-duality is not a
self bias non-duality is a transcendence of all self biases
if you ever manage to do that and that is
possible to do it's amazing that it's possible but it's
possible people have done it you can do it it's
just tricky so one of the ultimate counterintuitive moves you
can make in life is breaking loyalty with yourself with
your family with your tribe with your nation with your
religion with your reason with your race with your human
species all the stuff that you identify with that you
hold so dear is so important and so valuable to
you your tradition your heritage your ancestry your symbols all
of this I'm suggesting a radical way to improve your
life take all of that and throw it in the
incinerator and trust that your life will improve if you
do that and I know that seems kind of crazy
and I know that that's the last thing you want
to do but if you do this I'm telling you
you will have the best life possible and you might
wonder well Leo what's the reward for me doing all
this what's in it for me if I do all
this well first of all notice that's the wrong question
to ask but second of all there actually is a
reward and the reward is the truth with a capital
T God immortality and infinite love that is the reward
for living in unbiased life but do you understand what
that reward really means no you don't unless you've actualized
living an unbiased life which you probably have it so
you're gonna need to have some faith you need to
do some work you know I did about a decade
or two of work before I I actualized the fruits
of an unbiased life of an unbiased worldview and was
it worth it [ __ ] yeah it was worth
it you won't regret it it's the greatest move you'll
ever make in your life that's it I'm signing off
here one little tip I'll I'll leave you with is
go to my book list if you purchased it and
do a ctrl F or if you're on a Mac
command F search of the the pages of my book
list and search for a book with the title mistakes
the keyword mistakes is gonna be in the title of
the book mistakes and then read that book that book
talks about soft bias and soft justification it talks about
it gives very concrete specific examples within medicine within science
within law of ways in which people have been extremely
self biased and all the calamity and problems that this
led to it so it's a really good book mistakes
is in the name of the title so you will
search for it and find it that's it I'm done
here please click like button for me and come check
out actualized at org that's my website you'll find my
blog where I post a lot of insights and videos
and resources that I share pretty cool stuff that you
only find there I also sometimes post unique vlog videos
that I only shoot for my blog so check those
out I update it kind of randomly but consistently you'll
also find my book list that I just mentioned you'll
find a life purpose course and you'll find the forum
where you can chat about all this stuff and the
last thing that I'll say is this of course actualized
org as a school or as a teaching has its
biases I have a certain personality I have certain things
that I resonate with other things that I don't resonate
with I have certain a certain teaching style I have
a certain style the way that my mind works and
so the way that I teach of course is filtered
through me and it can't be otherwise now of course
there are some biases which are harmless there are some
biases which can be very toxic and damaging so I
tried to avoid exposing you to any damaging and toxic
biases that I might have I'm very careful about that
but that still leaves me with many just kind of
like no normal biases the way that I do spirituality
the way that I talk about the spirituality you know
there's various different kinds of spiritual paths one can have
one can have a path of love one can have
a path of intellect one can have a path of
yoga or meditation or karma or whatever you know these
various different paths that exist different methods there can be
a more feminine spirituality can be a more masculine spirituality
there can be a spirituality for introverts or spirituality for
extroverts there can be a spirituality which is kind of
grounded in science and there can be a spirituality which
is grounded very new agey type of stuff like very
mystical and doesn't care about science at all so you
know I do make certain kinds of choices you know
my teachings are a little bit more masculine feminine my
teachings are a little bit more scientific and intellectual than
certain other teachings I have certain biases and that I
favor for example sharing insights and understanding understanding is very
important to me not just shutting off my mind so
my teachings aren't intellectual whereas certain other spiritual teachings are
kind of anti intellectual they're more emotional or they're more
bodily if you're doing hatha yoga or whatever so yeah
so these various biases of course do exist and I've
been I've been pointing them out to you pretty much
from the beginning which is why I've been trying to
expose you to various different schools different teachings the way
one of the most important ways that we counteract our
self biases is precisely by studying lots of diverse sources
and acknowledging that our way my way is not the
only way for example I talked about psychedelics a lot
for me it's been a powerful tool for you maybe
it's not going to be or maybe it will you
know it depends I have a bias toward psychedelics other
people don't other teachers don't that's fine don't expect everybody
to be equal that's not the point of this topic
of it's just that you got to be aware of
it and also it means you got to expose yourself
cross pollinate in the intellectual domain you know cross pollinate
different traditions schools thoughts ideas all of this this will
make life much richer for you and expose many blind
spots and keep you from getting trapped into cults and
toxic ideologies which can SAP your life and get you
painted into a corner to the point where you just
get so stuck that it becomes them a condition for
the rest of your life and that's that's the key
that we want to avoid you
