[Music] let's talk about the dangers of psychedelics as you
probably already know i'm a huge advocate for psychedelics using
them for personal development and for spiritual development to raise
your consciousness and i've been very positive in the past
i've i've released trip report videos and i've discussed various
benefits and insights that i've received from psychedelics and i've
also talked about some of the dangers in the past
but i wanted to record an episode specifically addressing all
the dangers because sometimes i get the sense that people
misunderstand me and i do very much care about how
psychedelics are misused and abused by people and there are
a lot of immature people who go into psychedelics who
don't do their research and don't think through some of
the stuff that could potentially occur when you're using psychedelics
so for that reason and precisely because i'm such a
huge advocate of them and i tend to speak so
positively about them i wanted to do one episode that
just focuses exclusively on the negatives and the dangers so
this is going to be a lopsided episode and if
all you hear about psychedelics is this episode you're going
to get a skewed perspective because i'm not going to
be talking about any of the good stuff none of
the benefits just the bad stuff here all right and
and various kinds of precautions that you should be taking
so this is to sober your mind this is the
information you need if you're going to be tripping seriously
and uh i have a lot of insight about the
dangers and the risks for several reasons first of all
because i've done a lot of psychedelics myself i've done
over 100 trips at various dosages from low to very
high and i've done everything some of the most powerful
psychedelics that there are i've done mushrooms lsd i've done
dpt dmt 5meodmt foraco dmt other research chemicals that most
people don't even know about new research chemicals that nobody
knows about that i'll be introducing and sharing in the
future salvia like i've done some crazy stuff um there's
still there's still some that i haven't done that i'll
maybe do in the future but anyways uh so i'm
coming from direct experience here i have a lot of
experience with this i've had a few bad trips myself
uh i've i've studied this field a lot theoretically as
well i've read a lot of trip reports i've interacted
with a lot of people who have done psychedelics i've
watched people take psychedelics i've seen the kinds of reactions
that can happen i've dealt with the followers of mine
who report having done psychedelics and then report various kinds
of problems that arise for them and so that's where
i'm coming from so here's a list this is going
to be a very comprehensive list like of 20 or
30 things that are the top dangers this is pretty
much all the dangers that there are that i can
think of at least so first and foremost is overdosing
that's at the top of the list now with overdosing
there's really two issues here there's a mild version of
it and then the extreme version of it the extreme
version of it is literally you take so much that
you kill yourself that's pretty difficult to do with most
psychedelics almost impossible with something like mushrooms or lsd you
need to take a ridiculously large amount um although there
are certain research chemicals and other psychedelics that you could
take where you could kill yourself like with mdma the
lethal dose for mdma is actually not that high so
it's conceivable so that is a serious danger you want
to understand what the dosages are and what the lethal
dosages are and stay far away from those so there's
that the the more common though version of overdosing is
simply taking a dose that's too high and this i
think is perhaps one of the most common single most
common problems with psychedelics is that you just take a
dose that's too high and the reason this happens is
because people are sloppy they're not carefully weighing their dosages
with a milligram scale the way they should be they're
just popping stuff hoping that they got the right dose
this is extremely reckless and will lead to to dangerous
situations uh when your dose gets too high you're unable
to navigate you might lose bodily function you might pass
out you might lose consciousness and then depending on where
you are physically that could potentially lead to a lethal
situation or a very dangerous situation you might physically harm
yourself fall over crack your skull open this sorts of
stuff or you just might become seriously disoriented for a
few hours leading to all sorts of psychological problems an
existential crisis or something like that and i think the
reason this happens is that people are just too cocky
and they overestimate how much they can handle and they
underestimate how powerful psychedelics are there is i guarantee you
that there is not a there is not a dose
of psychedelic at which you will be able to handle
it there's always going to be some dose at which
you won't be able to handle it and it will
freak you out and it will be a net negative
for your development personally and spiritually so the solution to
this is very simple stay within the low to moderate
dose range there's no need to go to the crazy
high doses i think another big problem here is that
people get kind of egotistical about this whole thing and
they want to outdo themselves by doing more and more
and more thinking that the more they do the the
more they're going to deconstruct their ego the closer they're
going to reach to enlightenment or you know they're going
to have some sort of bragging rights on online forums
like oh i did 500 or a thousand micrograms of
lsd look how you know look how great i am
and uh in practice this is going to actually set
you back and you're going to regret it and nothing
is nothing is gained by this sort of game that
there's nobody that you need to one-up with your dose
uh not anyone else and certainly not even yourself it's
not about getting to high doses it's about becoming more
conscious and you can actually become more conscious of stuff
at moderate doses sometimes than at high doses because at
high doses it's just too crazy and your mind is
not able to integrate and make sense of it what
really matters is making sense of it and letting it
transform your everyday life not reaching such a crazy peak
that is so crazy that you can't even hold it
in your memory afterwards so just keep it in the
moderate to low dose range check your ego the next
danger is simply physical harm all sorts of physical harm
of course is possible especially if you're taking high doses
where you become disoriented you lose control of your body
or simply you're using your body in a reckless manner
you might hit your arms your legs you might trip
you might fall over depending on where you are if
you're especially in some sort of outdoors environment in a
crowded environment like a rave setting or a nightclub setting
these can be quite dangerous if you're not careful at
night you're not looking where you're going um so you
want to be doing these psychedelics generally in a indoor
environment where it's safe there's no balconies no ledges no
sharp corners where you can crack your skull open this
sort of stuff and another way to prevent this kind
of physical harm is simply to actually discipline yourself to
sit still when you're tripping i've read a lot of
trip reports where people are running around jumping around flailing
their arms running naked through the streets outside this is
where you will physically harm yourself so just discipline yourself
to sit still sit still and contemplate and then you're
gonna avoid the physical harm don't be doing psychedelics on
rooftops on balconies with high ledges places where you can
trip over fall down common sense stuff another related danger
with the physical harm is is vomiting so people commonly
vomit on psychedelics although i've done 100 trips plus and
i've never vomited once so it really is a matter
of of being careful with your protocol you don't have
to be vomiting but a lot of people do because
they're not careful they do psychedelics after eating which is
mostly why you vomit and uh and then if you're
gonna be taking a high dose you might pass out
if you're vomiting and passing out at the same time
this potentially creates a lethal situation so again be careful
a very easy way to avoid vomiting on psychedelics is
simply to follow the following rule which is don't take
psychedelics within four hours of eating anything that's my rule
that's the rule that i follow that means that i
will not take a psychedelic unless i haven't eaten for
four hours this ensures i have an empty stomach and
then there's nothing to vomit even if you feel like
vomiting you're not going to have anything to vomit at
that point so it's very easy to avoid vomiting the
next danger is bad trips the classic bad trip now
there's different degrees of bad trips there's bad trips and
there's really really really bad trips those are the ones
you especially want to avoid most people have no idea
how bad of a bad trip can get because people
totally underestimate the power of consciousness see consciousness is all-powerful
and it's infinite consciousness is rendering your entire sense of
reality and everything you've ever seen or known and consciousness
can literally imagine conjure up and manifest anything that you
can possibly imagine and even things you can't imagine the
worst nightmares can come to life on psychedelics think of
the worst nightmare you've ever had in your life and
then imagine it being manifest as real or even more
real than this physical reality that you're in right now
and imagine that lasting for two three five hours and
in fact it's even worse than that because when you're
in these psychedelic peaks there's no notion of time so
some of these horrific trips can seem like they last
for for eternity literally eternity so imagine being stuck in
the worst possible hellish nightmare you can imagine where you're
being tortured and devils are coming at you and all
sorts of crazy things you're in total madness and it
seems like you're stuck there for eternity and it seems
like you'll never return that's another aspect of these bad
trips is that it's not like you're having a bad
trip and then you can just kind of convince yourself
that oh well okay everything's gonna be fine i'll be
back to normal in a few hours sometimes you can
reassure yourself that way but if you're in a really
really bad trip that there won't be that reassurance because
you're going to actually believe that you are fully in
that new reality you're going to completely lose memory of
even having an old reality to come back to or
an old life you're going to forget all about material
existence you're going to be in that new reality it's
going to be a hellish reality you're going to have
no control over it your ego is not going to
be able to manipulate it you're going to be stuck
in thought loops that you won't be able to control
and it's just going to be this downward infinite spiral
into hell that is possible beware of that and the
way you avoid that is lower your doses those kind
of super bad trips usually happen when you dose too
high and also you need to ground yourself and be
sort of psychologically healthy so that you don't have a
paranoid mind the more paranoid your mind is the more
likely you are to go into these negative thought spirals
and uh and then lose control and go into these
states of madness so that's certainly possible be careful with
that especially if you have a a mind that tends
to be depressive and negative and you're not able to
to control your thoughts very well you're not able to
cut off negative thoughts and you tend to dwell on
those be careful because that will get you into bad
trip territory then your doses need to be very low
the next danger with psychedelics is simply facing fear and
trauma most people get involved with psychedelics are fairly immature
and also tend to have quite a bit of trauma
in their life from their childhood and adolescence and they
also tend to be fairly fearful and so what psychedelics
of course will do is they will deconstruct your mind
and your reality they will screw with your sense of
what you think is real and unreal they will get
you to confront traumas shadow sides of yourself the sides
and aspects of your psyche that you've been repressing and
hiding and so if you have a lot of that
shadow material if you have a lot of trauma you've
been repressing it's going to come out psychedelics will force
that to come out now that's not a bad thing
that's actually a good thing the psychedelic is doing this
because this is actually necessary for your personal and spiritual
growth but that doesn't mean it's going to feel good
and it also doesn't mean that your ego is going
to be prepared to handle it maybe it will maybe
it won't really it depends on how much is brought
up how quickly this is why if you keep your
doses low to moderate you can gradually start facing some
of your fears and traumas in a way that you
can handle but if you just jack up the dose
without gradually ramping yourself up it's going to be more
than you can handle and this is going to set
you back this is one of the counterintuitive aspects of
doing this psychedelic work is that you think that like
well i'm going to push my dose higher and higher
and higher because you know the more i can do
the better right well not necessarily think about it like
going to the gym if you just go to the
gym and you haven't ever gone and then the fur
on the first day you think you can bench press
or squat 200 300 pounds like you see other people
doing because you think oh well i should be as
good as them i don't want to look like a
or something and and so you try to squat or
bench to 300 pounds on your first go what are
you going to do you're going to hurt yourself you're
going to sprain a muscle you're going to break something
and this is actually going to force you to stay
out of the gym for the next few months you
might even damage your spine to such a degree that
you'll have a spinal injury for the next 10 years
of your life with chronic pain and counterintuitively this will
actually slow your progress at the gym so the proper
approach of the gym is to go slow and steady
and gradually build yourself up over a period of months
and years to get to those very high weights that's
how people get there well with psychedelics it's the same
thing and one of the biggest problems i see is
that people take one of those heroic doses because they
want to prove their machoness or whatever uh they're not
able to handle it they freak themselves out too much
fear too much trauma comes up this scares them from
ever doing psychedelics again or it requires that they take
a couple of years off just to reground themselves and
in so doing they actually slow their progress psychedelics are
just like the gym it does very little good to
go to the gym once and to lift a very
heavy weight once it doesn't really change you it doesn't
grow you what works is to do a little bit
consistently over months and years that's what really benefits you
same thing with psychedelics but as you're doing that you
want to make sure that you don't freak yourself out
so much that you get ptsd anxiety nightmares depression you
fall into some sort of solipsism or have some sort
of profound spiritual or existential crisis that prevents you from
doing the personal development work and the consciousness work that
you should be doing on a regular basis the next
danger with psychedelics is the potential for psychological instability ungrounding
of the mind deconstruction of the mind nihilism a loss
of sense of reality a loss of your illusions and
depersonalization all of these can happen some of these can
be good but again it's really a matter of degree
if it happens to you a little bit each time
you can handle it but if you get too much
of it all at once you're not going to be
able to handle it and your life can spiral out
of control you can literally have a psychotic break you
can have an existential crisis that will lead you to
make rash decisions in your life that will harm you
and that you will later regret you can lose sense
of what's real you can feel like you're losing your
mind you can feel like you're going insane you can
end up in a mental institution i know several people
to whom that's happened and you don't want that you
can go into this spiral of depression or nihilism where
you feel like nothing matters anymore your life doesn't matter
you lose joy for life you lose all sense of
meaning and then this can cascade throughout your entire life
into your family into your career and other things and
lead to a lot of destruction so you do have
to be very careful about that we're trying to deconstruct
the mind in general that's a good thing but it
does matter the rate at which you do it you
have to deconstruct your mind in a way where it
doesn't become dysfunctional where your mind doesn't spiral out of
control into some sort of craziness so watch out for
that another danger is simply confusion psychedelics can make you
very confused about reality and life and what's really going
on and this confusion can just be emotionally stressful and
difficult to cope with and it can last for months
or years depending on how much tripping you're doing and
what kind of confusion you have now in general confusion's
not a bad thing confusion factor is a good thing
i have a whole episode called how to deal with
confusion so confusion's not bad per se as long as
it doesn't make you do stupid and rash things in
your life the next danger is mental illness some of
you who are going to be doing these psychedelics have
mental illnesses bipolar disorder schizophrenic tendencies and or depression or
ptsd or anxiety or whatever you got you got to
be careful with the mental illnesses because the psychedelics can
exacerbate those they can crank those up to 11. and
um and then what's going to happen is that then
you're going to end up probably at a mental institution
where they're going to over medicate you and those medications
are going to further throw off the balance of your
body and your mind and it's not going to lead
to a good situation you're going to get addicted to
those medications then it's going to take you months and
years to wean yourself off those medications so if you
have a mental illness depending on what kind you have
of course there's a lot of variety there lots of
difference in degrees if you have a mild one you
can still take psychedelics and effects like alex can actually
help with mental illness but you have to be extra
extra careful and you have to keep your doses low
moderate don't go into the high doses and if you
have some severe mental illnesses then perhaps stay away from
psychedelics altogether if you do have a mental illness i
recommend you research very deeply your mental illness and then
reports from people with that mental illness who have been
taking psychedelics and just to see what those reports are
like how those people have been handling it and you
can learn from their experiences whether it's help them or
it's actually hurt them so you can find all those
reports online so let's say you have bipolar disorder you
can go into google and type in something like reddit.com
bipolar disorder and then whatever psychedelic you're gonna plan to
take like lsd you type that phrase into google and
then you will get reports of people with bipolar disorder
who have been doing lsd you can see their dosages
you can see what kind of effects they've been experiencing
whether it was positive or negative and you can use
that to kind of get an idea of maybe what
to expect but even then there's no guarantees and the
more severe your mental illness is potentially the more things
can go wrong so just be careful but also if
you're stuck in a profound mental illness and there's no
cure and you've tried everything else and nothing has helped
you do consider the possibility that psychedelics can help with
mental illness now it depends on what kind of illness
you have what kind of psychedelic you use how you
use it and so forth but you can also do
research into various academic studies and programs and clinical treatments
that exist around the world that actually do help with
depression ptsd anxiety by using various kinds of psychedelics so
that's not a myth that there's some really good science
behind that and actually very soon we're going to have
the first um fda approved use of psychedelics for treatment
of depression ptsd and other things that's coming in the
next few years and this is going to be there's
going to be legit treatments that are going to be
available through various kinds of clinics and licensed doctors and
therapists so it's real science it works it's not just
hippie mumbo jumbo the next danger is that psychedelics can
interfere with your pursuit of success business career family and
relationships so if you're really into self-help the way that
i was especially five or ten years ago and you're
in that spiro dynamic stage orange phase where you are
working really hard on your business on your dating life
on your family whatever it is and you're you've built
up a good momentum there be careful with psychedelics because
they can derail that momentum and in fact that happened
to me and that was perhaps one of the biggest
biggest downsides that i personally experienced from psychedelics um it's
kind of both a downside and upside is that of
course psychedelics take you beyond the material domain beyond material
existence so they're going to make all the material stuff
you do on a daily level seem very petty and
trivial and meaningless this is sort of the point that's
what transcendence is about you're transcending the material domain um
but for a lot of people they're so immature and
underdeveloped that for them transcending the material domain they're not
ready for that yet maybe 10 years from now they'll
be ready for that but not yet and that can
be a problem because like if you're in the middle
of building your business and then you start doing mushrooms
you might start to rethink whether you should be doing
business at all or going to work at all or
whether you should be having a family at all and
that might be a problem now that might also be
a good thing maybe the business you're working on maybe
the job and the career you have is a bad
career and it's making you miserable and depressed in which
case you got to think about leaving it or changing
it somehow but also maybe not maybe actually your business
is the right business maybe your family actually isn't a
bad family maybe you've got to keep working on it
maybe your family is is one of the most important
aspects of your life and it's going to be a
beautiful thing if you keep working on it but if
you just quit because you're second guessing yourself you're gonna
regret regret that later that could be a big mistake
for me personally what i noticed is that when i
started doing psychedelics they made me a lot less productive
i was always very very productive in my life and
i still am to some degree but since i started
doing psychedelics i've become much less productive and that is
because simply the productivity has lost its meaning you realize
you're in a rat race you realize that no matter
how much you work you're never going to be satisfied
with your work uh whether you're an artist or a
business person no matter how much money you earn it's
never going to be enough it's never going to make
you happy you're never going to reach a point in
your business where you're fully satisfied with your business and
so this undermines your motivation for your business and this
can be a problem especially for example if you face
financial difficulties maybe you need to work on your business
just so that you can pay your bills and now
is not the time for you to be questioning that
on the other hand maybe if you reached a point
in your business the way that i had when i
started doing psychedelics where my business was fairly stable i
was comfortable with my financial situation and i could afford
to take sort of a back seat and coast a
little bit maybe take a few years off or work
half time i can afford to do that nowadays where
i couldn't in the past and so in that sense
i can sort of shift my priority from productivity mode
more into spirituality mode more into contemplation mode more into
sort of consciousness work mode into the metaphysics of life
but understand there's gonna be a cost to that and
i would estimate that i have lost probably at least
hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars from my
decision to do psychedelics simply in productivity losses simply because
i've been less motivated to be materially productive now you
could say well but in the long term that's actually
good for you spiritually yeah maybe but still you do
have to consider the material dimension it is nice to
have hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars you know
and not to be losing that simply from going off
into into psychedelic territory so just do keep that in
mind and i don't know for example i don't have
a family like a my own family with children and
wife and stuff that i'm really responsible for so in
that sense i didn't encounter any problems there but i'm
sure i would have if i had some serious committed
relationships in marriage and children and so forth and a
deep family life i don't know that those psychedelics would
have certainly gotten me to start questioning that stuff and
i don't know what would happen there so be careful
if you're someone who has a serious family life and
values that uh and the next danger of psychedelics is
that you can potentially use them to escape tackling the
problem of survival and building a good life honestly for
most people who watch my videos their problem is not
a lack of enlightenment although of course none of them
are enlightened but uh their problem is more basic than
that their problem is simply mastering survival just being able
to survive in a competent way in an excellent way
for most people that's their problem in life and so
if you're struggling to build a career if you're struggling
to get laid if you're lonely if you're struggling to
manage your emotions your anger your depression your anxiety if
you're if you're dealing with these just very basic problems
and then you jump deep into psychedelic territory what might
happen is the psychedelics might kind of convince you that
oh well i don't need to worry about any of
that material stuff you know who cares about having a
job who cares about cleaning the house who cares about
feeding the children who cares about taking out the trash
who cares about building a good life all that's all
that's just illusions and dreams and instead i'm gonna i'm
gonna go into the mystical realms because that's where the
good stuff's at right that can be a trap a
very big trap because i guarantee you no matter how
high you go into the mystical realms no matter how
deep of a god realization you reach or what kind
of dmt alien entities you speak to and what kind
of wisdom they download to you or whatever you're going
to come back down into mundane material reality where you're
going to have bills to pay children to feed house
to clean uh a physical body to take care of
and all the chores and other obligations that come with
surviving in material life and that is not something you
want to do poorly that is something you want to
face head on and you want to start to master
that stuff and a lot of the things i've talked
about in the past in my older videos are about
that my life purpose course is all about that so
the danger is that you might start to take psychedelics
and then you might say oh well yeah i bought
leo's life purpose course but now i started doing psychedelics
i don't even want a life purpose it's all and
illusions and that would be a mistake because you're still
going to have to develop some degree of success in
physical material reality or if you don't you're going to
live in a miserable way on the material domain is
that something that you really want and how is that
going to affect your spiritual pursuits probably not very well
because when you're missing the foundation the material foundation of
your life when that has a bunch of problems in
it i guarantee you it's going to impact your spiritual
pursuits as well almost guaranteed so you do want to
keep one eye on the mystical domain on the psychedelic
domain but you do want to keep one eye on
the how do i build a good life just at
a very basic practical level how do i have a
decent job how do i get my bills paid and
so forth so that i'm financially secure and comfortable i'm
not scrambling running around i'm not homeless in other things
like this another potential danger is becoming too isolated it's
possible you start doing these psychedelics and you go deeper
and deeper into yourself you withdraw into yourself and into
your own mind and psyche and especially if you keep
doing them chronically you do a lot of them this
will happen more and more and more you stop talking
to your friends you stop talking to your family you
become very isolated and alone and then you can kind
of trap yourself in this solipsistic echo chamber and then
that can spiral out of control and then nobody is
there to help you or to reinforce you or to
kind of keep you within certain parameters and then you
can become anti-social and misanthropic you can start to hate
the world especially once you start to misinterpret some of
these psychedelic visions that you're having so make sure that
if you're doing psychedelics you also balance it out with
having a some kind of social life where you're not
becoming a total recluse another potential danger is making rash
decisions after a profound breakthrough trip you might come back
the next day and you might decide to divorce your
wife leave your children quit your job tell your boss
to go himself walk away from your business partners and
your business go travel the world sell your house give
away all your money to charity and this can really
end up biting you in the ass because usually even
though a psychedelic trip only lasts at most 12 hours
the next day 24 hours later you're gonna be completely
down from the trip the chemical will not be in
your system anymore however the lingering after effects on your
psyche will still remain and they usually remain for at
least a few days if not for the next week
especially after a deep trip and so for the rest
of that week you can be having sort of thoughts
that are not typically the kind of thoughts you would
be having which can cause you to make these sorts
of rash decisions so the best safety measure against this
is to simply have a rule for yourself that after
you trip you're not going to make any rash or
bold decisions for the next week just to make sure
that your mind comes back down all the way and
you're sober you're totally stabilized and then you can make
your decisions but don't make any important decisions like don't
be deciding to divorce your wife or leave your kids
or tell your boss to go himself three days after
a profound trip you're probably not thinking straight another danger
of psychedelics is that they can demotivate your meditation practice
and this has happened to me uh actually before i
started to do meditation i meditated i mean before i
started to do psychedelics i meditated very regularly for about
five years every single day without missing a single day
once i started doing psychedelics i started missing days of
meditation and i stopped meditating consistently and even for long
periods of time because what happens is that the psychedelics
take you into a realm of consciousness so high that
it becomes clear to you that you will never reach
these levels of consciousness through any kind of meditation practice
maybe if you're a professional monk and you do it
full-time it's your full-time job you do it all day
long for months maybe you can reach those stages or
those states of consciousness but certainly not with a one-hour
a day practice and even those monks those monks i
guarantee those monks have not reached levels of consciousness that
i've reached through psychedelics at my highest points so um
so this can be demotivating as far as meditation or
yoga practice because you might think like well what's the
point of meditating then especially because it's like here i
have been for five years meditating my ass off every
one hour every day and i still haven't been able
to reach the level of conscious i can reach in
15 minutes by taking some mushrooms or lsd like what
then what's the point and that that is true meditation
is simply not that effective compared to psychedelics so if
you compare them like that then meditation is not going
to seem so appealing so in a sense it's actually
easier to fool yourself to meditate when you don't know
that psychedelics are possible and this is actually i think
one of the secret reasons why a lot of buddhist
practitioners and yoga practitioners and teachers and so forth uh
they they stay away they instinctively stay away from psychedelics
and they have sort of a stigma about psychedelics and
one of the reasons why is because psychedelics will very
quickly reveal just how pitiful traditional meditation and yoga practices
are unless you do them for decades you know you
gotta really do them for decades for them to build
up that strength to the point where maybe they can
start to compete with psychedelics but you certainly can't do
it within a few years of practice and so um
so this can be a problem because it creates sort
of this idea that well meditation is useless yoga is
useless but then if all that is useless then what
do you what's the work you're going to actually do
to raise your baseline level of conscious because because psychedelics
are not going to raise your baseline level of consciousness
that much you're going to come back down at the
end of the day and so that kind of leaves
you nowhere and so what i recommend is that if
you do psychedelics you still maintain your meditation practice or
self-inquiry practice or yoga practice you need some sort of
manual daily practice that you maintain that will be raising
your baseline state over a period of years and decades
and then on top of that you're doing these spikes
and hits with psychedelics that take you to these crazy
peaks but just be aware that it can demotivate that
practice in you and so you're gonna have to compensate
for that somehow in your mind another danger is falling
into chronic usage so my personal advice is not to
use psychedelics more than once every two weeks have i
broken that rule myself in the past yes i have
i've done a period of 30 days straight at 5
amio dmt high doses that was a very crazy experience
i have a whole episode about that you can go
find it where i talk about that but that was
done in a very deliberate almost scientific experiment like way
just to see what actually happens see i like to
experiment with my consciousness i do all sorts of weird
experiments like that but for normal people i don't recommend
something like that because if you start to use these
psychedelics chronically what's going to happen is that they will
they will erode your mind and your sense of reality
and your life will turn upside down and you will
stop being able to think straight and in fact that
that did happen to me during my 30-day trial of
experiment of 5 amio dmt by the end by the
end of those 30 days i didn't even make it
to 30 days i only did about 28 days um
the last two days i didn't even need to take
any more because i was constantly high i was just
i had so much five meo dmt in my system
that for the last two days it was like i
was on 5mu dmt 247 without taking any and it
was getting to the point where like it was really
really interfering with my with my mind and my sense
of reality in my life and so if i continued
any further it would have started to become disaster so
i stopped um and that was a good experiment for
me to try because now i can i can teach
from that wisdom that i gained but i would advise
you not to do that in fact i recommend that
you take long periods between trips to integrate even doing
psychedelics twice a month really it's too much if you
do that consistently you're not going to be able to
integrate everything that they're revealing to you so be careful
about that and if you start using it chronically what's
going to happen is uh it's going to become a
crutch and a sort of addiction and you're going to
use it as an escape from actually doing the real
manual labor that you need to do to develop yourself
and grow yourself another trap that can happen in danger
is the danger of misinterpreting various kinds of mystical visions
that you can have on psychedelics so you're gonna have
all sorts of different visions and insights will be revealed
to you but the thing is is that you still
have an ego maybe not at the peak but when
you come back down the ego is still going to
be there and the ego is going to try to
make sense of all these crazy experiences you've had and
i guarantee you it's going to corrupt them and it's
going to try to co-opt them and to use them
towards its own selfish purposes and here is where you
run into the problem of zen devilry false notions of
enlightenment a messiah complex you get a giant big head
about all this you start to proclaim yourself to be
god and you sort of tell everybody that you're god
and how great you are and how powerful you are
and now you think you have abilities to heal people
and to change the world to awaken everybody and this
can get very dangerous you might get the idea to
build a cult you might get the idea that you
can now that now you're qualified to teach people and
then of course what you're going to be teaching them
is some corrupt version of this of the truth and
so just be very careful because your mind is very
self-deceptive and it's especially self-deceptive when you come down from
a high mystical experience and then these visions you have
you can have all sorts of mystical visions but they
don't necessarily mean what you think they mean at face
value your mind can easily imagine and hallucinate all sorts
of stuff maybe in you know you do some mushrooms
a heroic dose of mushrooms and then you experience jesus
coming to you because you're from a christian tradition so
to you it's jesus jesus comes to you and jesus
delivers a personal message to you that now you are
the messenger of jesus here on earth and then you
actually believe that and then you come back down from
the trip and now you actually believe that you are
the the disciple of christ who has been ordained to
convert all the heathens to christianity or something like that
you see the psychedelics they will exacerbate any kind of
uh biases and um self-deceptions that you have going in
your mind so it's very important that for you to
gain the most out of psychedelics that you actually have
a pure mind a mind that has inquired into itself
outside of the psychedelic trip and has cleared and purged
out various kinds of biases and egotisms and shadow sides
and selfishness because if you don't if you have this
dirty corrupt mind you have your mystical vision it's going
to come back you're going to come back down and
then you're going to reinterpret it and and then you're
going to corrupt it with all the corruptions in your
own mind it's going to all get corrupted all mixed
together you won't be able to tell the truth from
the from the mystical vision from the selfish personal needs
you have and the egotisms and shadow sides that you
have it's all going to mix together and then it's
going to turn into this toxic mystical stew and then
you're gonna go run around trying to infect everybody else
with it and this is what i would call zen
devilry it's also possible that you have sort of mystical
vision or awakening even and then you come back down
and now you think you fully understand reality when you
don't you only saw one facet a small facet of
the truth not the whole truth there's many facets i
have an episode called the many facets of awakening go
check that out there's at least a dozen or more
facets to awakening and it usually takes you multiple trips
over a period of months and years to assemble all
the facets and to see the big picture one or
two trips is not gonna be enough so it's easy
to misinterpret some of these visions or insights or to
think that you got it all figured out when actually
you don't and so you do have to be very
careful about that just be aware that you can certainly
deceive yourself about awakening and mystical visions and you can
misinterpret those and you can misinterpret them very badly so
be aware of that the next danger is actually the
pain of being disconnected from god as i call it
so what will happen if you're doing psychedelics properly is
that you will eventually reach a stage of god consciousness
where you become conscious of god and these are going
to be some of the most beautiful and profound experiences
you've ever had in your life it will be the
most important thing that's ever happened to you and it's
going to be the most beautiful thing and then you're
going to fall out of it you're going to lose
it the next day and then you're going to wonder
well how do i get it back and then god
itself will become like the thing that you chase you
will become intoxicated with god with the idea of becoming
god or being one with god or the feeling of
god's love and all this is so intoxicating this this
infinite love is so intoxicating that it's gonna pain you
just going through your everyday life being disconnected from this
love and from god this could potentially get so bad
you might even get suicidal because you might say to
yourself well what's the point of living here in this
material existence why do i have to go to my
crappy job to my crafty family to my crappy wife
with my crappy children and my crappy friends when i
should be up there in heaven with god and then
you might start having suicidal thoughts or you just might
be dreaming about the next time you can do psychedelics
it's like well okay i can't wait to come back
home from my work and then do more psychedelics and
you do that every day and then it becomes a
becomes an addiction for you where you're using it as
an escape from material existence and obligations and survival and
it can it can just actually lower the quality of
your life so counter-intuitively what's happened when i started doing
using psychedelics is that i had the most profound mystical
experiences some of the peaks of my life the best
experiences of my life were on psychedelics but then when
i was just going through my ordinary life i noticed
that i was actually less happy than i used to
be before psychedelics because before psychedelics my ordinary life that's
all i knew and i was kind of living in
this blissful ignorance once you actually realize infinite love and
heaven and god but then you can't inhabit that 24
7 your ordinary life then seems very pale by comparison
and so that's that's it's challenging to cope with that
you have to sort of relearn to appreciate just the
paleness of mundane existence because it's so pathetic compared to
the peaks you can achieve on psychedelics so be careful
with that it can lead to some kind of uh
addiction if not a physical addiction because you can't really
get physically addicted on psychedelics uh it can become a
psychological addiction especially if your ordinary life kind of sucks
and you got nothing going for you in ordinary life
then i can definitely see how these psychedelic peaks they
can become like a an escape and it becomes your
sole purpose for living is just to escape into these
psychedelic peaks and that is not going to be healthy
or sustainable in the long term so be careful with
that speaking of suicide that's the next danger psychedelics can
make some people suicidal for various reasons maybe because you
feel like you're losing your mind maybe because you feel
like life is meaningless and you've fallen into some sort
of nihilistic solipsistic funk maybe because you've misinterpreted one of
these visions or insights or had an incomplete awakening maybe
because you've had some sort of derealization and you're stuck
in that uh or maybe because you want to merge
and become one with god and you want to and
you don't want to do that work at the material
level so you just want to you want to quickly
solve that through some sort of physical suicide so of
course this would be very foolish uh i recommend that
you don't do this i recommend that you don't harm
your body at all i recommend that you don't even
consider suicide as a possibility for yourself and of course
if you're taking psychedelics and then you're noticing yourself having
suicidal thoughts then the first thing you should do is
you should completely discontinue psychedelics for at least three to
six months don't do them at all reground yourself in
ordinary life but of course psychedelics can have the opposite
effect too for many suicidal people psychedelics can't actually be
the cure because psychedelics can show you something beyond the
material domain in which maybe your suicide is grounded in
because if you're dissatisfied with the material domain which a
lot of suicidal people are then what you're really looking
for is you're looking for the spiritual domain but you
don't know how to access it because you can't meditate
you can't do yoga you can't self-inquire you know you
don't have those skills built up so psychedelics can show
you that higher domain they can show you love they
can help you to deal with trauma a lot of
suicide is is rooted in trauma they can help lift
your depression they can show you the miracle of life
of life the miracle of love of consciousness of god
and so in this sense they can prevent suicide but
they can also cause you it depends right it really
depends on how you use it the next danger is
the legal side of things so you have to be
very careful with how you're using these substances because these
substances are illegal in many parts of the world but
not all parts it depends and it also depends which
substances so you should familiarize yourself with the legal nuances
of these substances you should know what the legal ramifications
are for getting caught with them you should know which
substances are legal and which are not legal in your
area and this all requires research depends on where you
live you should think carefully about how you're handling these
substances how you're driving around with them how you're carrying
them around what the policing situation is like um and
you should take precautions around all that to make sure
that you're as safe as possible and you also want
to be very careful about supplying psychedelics to your friends
because you see it's one thing to get caught with
some weed or some mushrooms in your pocket that's one
thing it's another thing to be caught in the act
of supplying somebody else with psychedelics so there might be
this tendency with as you start to use psychedelics you
know you start to like them so much of course
then you want to share it with all your friends
and your family and then you start sending them psychedelics
and you start inviting them over for psychedelics and this
and that and then eventually what happens is that people
start talking and you get caught and when they catch
you in that situation they're not going to just try
you for owning a little bit of psychedelics they're going
to try you as a dealer and even if you
try to deny it and say oh well but i
wasn't dealing i was just like me and my friends
were just like smoking a joint or just doing some
mushrooms together me my girlfriend or something like no they're
going to try you as a dealer and you do
not want to be tried as a as a drug
dealer so make sure you take precautions such that uh
there could be no linkage between what you're doing and
dealing it's very very important and uh make sure that
you take responsibility for the legal consequences like do you
understand what would happen if you get caught do you
understand what the sentence terms are do you understand how
many years in jail you could spend research that that
will sober your mind to the realities of things because
if you don't research that you might say oh well
if i get caught i'll just get a few months
in jail when the reality is you might get 10
years in jail and you didn't even know that you
didn't even consider that so consider that but to consider
that you have to do your research i don't know
what country you live in and what substances you take
it all depends and then by the way if you
only want to do legal substances you can do that
too you can find countries and cities and other locations
and certain substances which are legal in those areas and
you can do this whole thing legally strictly legally if
you want to and then there's all sorts of different
quasi-legal gray areas too that you can explore so it
all depends on your risk tolerance i'm not your lawyer
and i'm not telling you what you should or shouldn't
do i'm just saying study this stuff so you know
what you're getting into and then avoid the serious the
most serious dangers another danger with psychedelics is simply taking
the wrong substance make sure you know what substance you're
taking don't take unknown substances sometimes i read people just
like oh yeah i took something i don't know what
it was this is this is crazy to me this
is crazy you have to know what your substance is
you have to know the source of where you got
it from where it came from you have to know
the dosage you have to be reasonably confident about the
dosage being accurate don't be taking substances from people you
don't know in random pill form you don't know what's
in that pill you should know where your substance is
coming from and it should be coming from a quasi-reliable
source at the very least if not a reliable one
the next danger is toxicity from impure substances again this
very much depends on the source if you're getting your
substance from a trusted source then this shouldn't be a
problem but if you're getting it from random people in
random places and you don't know what you're getting and
you don't know whether you can trust this person you
have no idea the impurities in the substance and certain
substances can contain fairly high impurities especially things like mdma
or lsd especially if you get it at a place
like a rave or at a music festival those can
be notoriously impure so be careful about that the next
danger is there are certain kinds of psychedelics that can
actually be physically damaging to your body these might include
ketamine mdma n bones dxm nitrous oxide and certain others
of course it depends how much you take them how
frequently you take them but uh but all of these
substances many of them that i listed here aren't really
even considered classic psychedelics so what i would recommend for
you is stick to the classic psychedelics that will not
physically damage your body like dmt mescaline mushrooms lsd these
will not physically damage your body and your brain in
most cases for normal people but uh but something like
mdma actually rewires permanently rewires your brain if you take
it too much it can lead to various kinds of
neurological damage ketamine can lead to damage of i believe
the bladder or the kidneys if you take it too
much and so can some of the other ones that
i listed so be careful with those try to stick
to the classic psychedelic because they're the safest they're the
most field tested and proven then there are some substances
that you shouldn't take at all really because they're dangerous
like salvia and deterra personally i've taken salvia but i
don't recommend you try it it screws with your motor
control it creates very very chaotic trips and deterra is
even worse so i warned you stay away from those
i'm not saying don't take them so that you take
them i'm actually saying don't take them so you don't
take them another danger is potential bad interactions between psychedelics
and medications especially the class of medications known as ssris
which are frequent amongst depressed users people who are depressed
so if you're on ssris don't combine that with psychedelics
and if you're on other kinds of medications antipsychotic medications
or whatever you have to seriously research whether there's going
to be a conflict with the medication and the substance
that you're taking potentially these conflicts and interactions can be
lethal so be careful another related danger to that is
mixing substances when you mix two or more chemical substances
together they can have a synergistic effect both positive or
negative and they can lead in directions that you couldn't
anticipate so there have been reported deaths for example from
people taking five meow dmt plus some sort of medication
they were on or if you combine 5 amio dmt
with a with a maui like you do without for
ayahuasca that could potentially turn into a lethal combination and
so when you're getting into these combinatorics of various medications
and supplements and psychedelics and you're taking multiple psychedelics together
this is where you're getting into dangerous territory so watch
out i would recommend that you don't do that just
stick to one chemical at a time so you clearly
know what effect what is having on your mind because
when you mix stuff together you won't know what's causing
what the more variables you mix in there of course
another danger of psychedelics is that uh you know as
cliche as this is to say but they can be
a gateway drug into recreational hard drugs like cocaine heroin
meth crack and so forth it doesn't have to be
that way but it can be that way because what's
going to happen is the psychedelics will open your mind
a lot and you will explore this realm psychedelics and
you will try different kinds and then you'll say to
yourself well all these psychedelics are not bad they're not
hurting my body how bad can it be so so
what if i let me go try some coke let
me go try some heroin and then your heroine turns
out to be laced with fentanyl and you kill yourself
or you try some meth and the meth actually turns
out to be ridiculously addictive unlike any psychedelics you've ever
tried and so that line can get blurred so be
careful especially because the sources that you're getting your psychedelics
from can also be the same sources that might be
offering you some of these recreational drugs so you have
to draw a real hard line between the recreational stuff
and the psychedelics and only stick to the psychedelics the
next possible danger is chronic weed addiction so a lot
of people like to combine psychedelics with weed and personally
i've never done that but i hear it's a good
combo it calms some people down takes the edge off
some of the trips okay that's let's say that's fine
sometimes the weed can actually make your trips more paranoid
and it can actually synergize in a negative way and
cause bad trips so keep that in mind it's going
to depend on you depend on the kind of strain
of weed you use whatever but also the other problem
is that then weed can become a chronic addiction unlike
psychedelics wheat is more used more chronically and it tends
to be addictive so even if you're using your psychedelics
only once a month but then you get into a
habit of using weed all the time that's not going
to be good for your development so i recommend you
avoid the wheat entirely another potential danger is tripping in
recreational areas like parties raves nightclubs bars tripping outdoors tripping
in the woods where there are wild animals and other
things you can crack your skull on so i recommend
you don't do psychedelics at these large crowded events like
music festivals parties raves this is uh if you do
that often you're gonna run into problems i guarantee it
best place to do psychedelics is just in a comfortable
room with nobody around nobody to interfere with you the
other danger is research chemicals so you might start to
get into the psychedelics you might try some lsd some
mushrooms then you decide to do some for eco dmt
which is basically a synthetic form of mushrooms and other
you know synthetic forms of lsd uh and so forth
and then you get into the research chemical field which
i've explored quite a bit but the danger there is
that with research chemicals there's dozens of different kinds there's
always new ones being released and then you might want
to like experiment with the new ones but the more
new they are the less people have validated them the
less they've been field tested the more danger there is
potentially that you're going to stumble upon something harmful and
so you got to be careful with the research chemicals
it's also possible that you might order some research chemicals
and what they send you is they send you the
wrong batch and then that can potentially be quite problematic
the next danger is something called hppd which is hallucinogen
persistent perception disorder and what this is is basically you
do so much psychedelics at such high doses that the
lingering psychedelic effects that has had on your visual field
and your auditory field actually something actually gets rewired in
your in your brain such that those lingering effects remain
even long after the trip and they can last for
months or years or a lifetime the most common symptoms
here might be tinnitus which is ringing in the ears
it's a very common one amongst folks so you can
get sort of a persistent chronic ringing in the ears
or you can get tracers or you can get other
kinds of visual distortions like visual noise in your visual
field and this can like i said this can last
your entire lifetime this happens in a very small percentage
of people but it does happen and i don't know
if we're sure exactly what causes it is it because
they did too high of a dose is it because
of their genetics something else maybe they mixed it with
medications we don't really know but um if you're concerned
about that research it it's called hppd you can find
plenty of case studies of it online on the forums
on reddit and so forth uh personally i've never had
it um but then again i'm very careful about my
dosing and i don't use chronically i don't overuse so
i think there might be a genetic component honestly as
well because most people just don't get it and then
some people do so just be aware of that risk
there might be a one percent chance risk that you'll
develop hppd especially if you do a lot or high
doses and for some people they report that that's that's
quite distressing and it interferes with their ability to enjoy
normal life so just be aware that the next danger
is with extracting synthesizing and dealing i've already mentioned a
little bit about dealing but see you might get into
psychedelics and then you might say to yourself well why
am i buying them i can just grow my own
mushrooms i can extract my own dmt i can maybe
even synthesize my own lsd or what i don't know
whatever lsd is not easy to synthesize but you might
get some stupid idea like that and again you know
once you start growing and extracting and synthesizing you're basically
at that point running a drug lab and if they
catch you they're not going to charge you as a
user and they're not even going to charge you as
a dealer they're going to charge you as a drug
lab so again be extremely careful about that don't do
anything reckless or stupid like that it's not worth it
you don't want to be charged with you know 20
years in prison for extracting some some stupid couple of
grams of dmt and they will easily charge you that
way if they catch you so you've been warned the
next danger is just various kinds of online scams shady
dealers and the possibility that you'll just get your money
stolen i've heard stories of people trying to buy stuff
online from random websites and just not getting their product
getting their money stolen they were total scams fake websites
so be careful about that and the last danger i'll
mention here is driving intoxicated make sure that if you're
on a psychedelic you have a rule for yourself that
you're not going to be driving getting into a car
you know sometimes i read these trip reports and it
just it baffles me how stupid and irresponsible people are
where the the guy you know he's writing his trip
report he's like yeah i took some lsd and then
um you know i took a quick shower as it
was coming on i took a quick shot you know
i have 30 minutes i took a quick shower and
then i got out of the shower i remembered oh
i forgot to i forgot to buy some just some
you know some um some some coke at the drugstore
i don't mean cocaine i mean just coca-cola some cocaine
at the at the local drugstore so let me go
and and get my my my daily coca-cola and so
he gets in the car and drives while he's you
know taking the lsd already and he's driving to get
his his coca-cola and then of course the lsd comes
on and then you know he can't even see straight
while he's in his car like something stupid like this
once you've taken the psychedelic sit the down pay attention
contemplate don't be thinking about anything else focus on your
trip don't be running anywhere don't be going anywhere don't
be going for a walk don't be driving anywhere and
then sit through it until it's all virtually gone and
then you can use your car again all right that's
it those are pretty much all the biggest dangers that
i could think of maybe there's a few more that
i'm forgetting but that's mostly what you got to know
now here's the thing you also got to know is
that i was only focusing on the worst of the
worst parts here so again this list might sound very
bad and you might say leo oh my god there's
all these dangers and problems i would never do psychedelics
now considering all this but consider this that the majority
of these dangers can be very easily avoided if you're
responsible thoughtful mindful and careful i've given you very quick
solutions to many of these problems now can you avoid
all of them no you can't avoid all of them
and if you're a very very risk-averse person then psychedelics
are simply not for you but also don't forget that
all of life is risk and much of life has
many bad potential outcomes if i did a list like
this of all the bad risks and problems and dangers
of driving or sex or business or relationships you would
never want to drive have sex do business or be
in a relationship ever in your life i mean there
are some serious dangers with driving there are serious dangers
with sex there are serious dangers in business you can
get sued your business partners can scam you your products
can kill people and then you feel guilty and responsible
for that morally and legally with sex you can catch
an std you can get somebody pregnant you might have
to pay alimony for the rest of your life or
the guy might impregnate you and then run off and
then you're stuck with the baby for the rest of
your life you think relationships are all safe no there's
there's many dangers in relationships your partner can cheat on
you can infect you with an std can steal all
your money and run away can hurt you emotionally in
many ways can rape you can abuse you can hit
you can potentially brainwash you can psychologically manipulate you gaslight
you could even kill you there's no insurance that your
partner won't kill you in the middle of your sleep
it happens suicidal partners oftentimes end up harming their spouse
or their girlfriend or their boyfriend or their children it
happens so there's risks life is all about risk it's
about managing the risk though right it's about taking reasonable
precautions you don't want to be paranoid over this stuff
but you do also want to be careful you don't
want to pretend like you're invincible you're not invincible and
i guess that's one of the other dangers of psychedelics
is that you start to do them and you might
start to feel like you're invincible because you might start
to say well but i'm god and god is immortal
and invincible well yeah god is immortal and invincible but
not your human life there are consequences in the relative
material domain so watch out so let me now quickly
run down a list of the top mistakes that psychedelic
users make these are the top ones number one is
treating psychedelics like toys not taking them seriously enough number
two is simply just being immature about the whole process
and being immature themselves which is why i would recommend
that if you're immature don't do psychedelics at all you're
gonna screw it up maturity is one of the most
important factors number three is just doing large doses and
not measuring them accurately this is such a huge mistake
number four is frequent and chronic usage of psychedelics number
five is tripping in dangerous areas with friends in social
environments there's a lot of noise and distraction number six
is moving around too much running around not sitting still
not contemplating i read trip reports of people who take
some mushrooms in the middle of the trip they strip
off all their clothes then run down the street naked
screaming this kind of stupidity will get you into trouble
this is what i mean by immaturity if you can't
control yourself don't trip sometimes people tell me well leo
but on a psychedelic trip i'm supposed to be free
i just want to let myself go yeah but you
can't let yourself go so much that you jump off
a balcony you can't let yourself go so much that
you strip off all your clothes and then you jump
through your neighbor's window into their living room if you
can't control yourself from doing those things if that's too
much to ask of you then don't trip the next
top mistake is mental illness people with mental illness who
are immature and mentally unstable they get into psychedelics and
then they spiral out of control and their mental illness
just gets worse and then they just keep doing it
more the next top mistake is zendelry go see my
episode called becoming a zen devil that explains how that
works and the next couple of mistakes are not enough
theoretical foundation which is all the stuff that i teach
with actualize.org the metaphysics the epistemics the spiritual theory the
non-dual theory the consciousness work and then the next mistake
is not doing the manual labor of personally developing yourself
and of spiritual growth assuming that the psychedelic will handle
everything for you you don't need to meditate you don't
need to contemplate anything you don't need to read any
books anymore you don't got to do any practices anymore
you don't want to watch any videos anymore you just
fly by the seat of your pants and you just
do psychedelics this is gonna be a disaster and the
final mistake and this one's very counterintuitive you know what
the final one is it's actually when you do a
few trips and you tell yourself ah okay i got
it i got the message now i'm hanging up the
phone i understand what psychedelics are that is the final
mistake if you've only done five or ten trips or
even 20 trips you have no clue what psychedelics are
no clue you're just a baby it's like you're in
first grade you know nothing about the world yet from
20 trips it requires about a hundred trips just to
start to get your bearings on what psychedelics are and
how they work and their potential for spiritual growth i
see a lot of people fooling themselves telling me oh
yeah i've done psychedelics i know what they're all about
and they've only done five trips this is laughable it's
totally laughable so don't fall into that mistake but of
course you have to spread your trips out i am
not saying that you got to do a bunch of
trips back to back treat this process as a long-term
process it's going to be a multi-year-long process of you
exploring this territory through dozens and ultimately hundreds of trips
and precisely because you're spreading it out and there's going
to be so much work here you got to be
very careful and methodical about it and follow the protocol
because the more you do something that's dangerous the more
risk is incurred so the more you're going to do
it the more careful you have to be makes sense
all right that's it i'm done here now you are
aware of all the dangers of psychedelics contemplate them take
them seriously and decide for yourself whether this is something
that you want to get involved with i am not
trying to convince you to do psychedelics that's a decision
you're going to make all by yourself i just want
to honestly outline their dangers and i also want to
talk about all their amazing potential benefits which i've talked
about in the past and i'll talk more about in
the future as well and so now we're going to
have a balanced perspective on these things all right so
please remember to click that like button for me and
come check out actualize.org that's my website here you will
find my book list you will find my life purpose
course you will find my blog you will find my
forum you can support me at patreon.com actualized you can
also find my second actualized channel called actualized clips with
shorter videos and the last thing i want to say
is that in the future i actually want to emphasize
more the importance of psychedelics in this work because what
i see is i see a lot of people who
follow my work who are lost and confused about these
metaphysical and epistemic subjects that i talk about the most
and they just get lost in mental masturbation theorizing about
god endlessly and about solipsism and about this and about
that and it just leads absolutely nowhere so it's very
important that if you're following my work that you actually
do the work doing the work can be done through
meditation through yoga through self-inquiry through psychedelics or other means
but honestly and i'm just being honest here from my
direct experience and i've experimented with all these different techniques
what i find is that psychedelics are the most direct
and they will give you the deepest and clearest understanding
of what reality is if that's what you want to
understand and it is very important i feel to understand
that even if you don't get a permanent enlightenment forget
about that just to understand what reality is to know
the truth to know what god is to know what
love is to know what truth is to know what
consciousness is just to have these answers is enormously beneficial
even if you don't get a permanent enlightenment it's enormously
beneficial to directly experience these things for yourself and psychedelics
are the only way many people will ever experience it
because most people simply aren't devoted enough committed enough to
meditate for 10 years to get there or to do
intense 10-day retreats or they're just not spiritually gifted enough
to do it a lot of people are spiritually gifted
but then they assume everybody else is too but they're
not so how do we deliver these understandings to those
who are not so spiritually gifted so in the future
i will be emphasizing psychedelics more i know that's controversial
and people criticize me for that but that's why i
wanted to release this episode here so that we are
doing this in a responsible way and again when i
say emphasize psychedelics more i'm not pushing psychedelics on you
you don't have to do them everything i teach everything
that's true god love consciousness truth and all the other
stuff all the epistemic stuff all of that is true
independent of psychedelics it doesn't matter whether you do them
or don't it's still going to be true you can
still access all the same truths without psychedelics but if
there is a direct way if there is a fast
easy way why not use it because i know that
many of you will simply never understand this stuff without
it i know personally and the reason i know that
is because honestly the level of understanding that i have
now of reality would absolutely for sure i guarantee would
not be possible without my use of psychedelics it would
not be possible not at this depth i could understand
bits and pieces of it but not as at this
level of depth and and if not for that if
not for the psychedelics and the clarity they gave me
then honestly the things i would be teaching you now
would be so shallow and distorted and corrupted that it
would really be a disservice to all of you and
so that's the place that i'm coming from is that
i know that if that happened to me i can
i can only it's it's scary to imagine uh the
situation that many of you are in and one of
the saddest things is that there are these amazing tools
that can help you to figure out and understand what
you are what reality is what life is how to
live a good life how to do spiritual work properly
there are these tools that can reveal this to you
quickly effortlessly um directly and yet these tools are being
misused they're being demonized or being stigmatized and they're not
being taken full advantage of and this situation simply cannot
hold as a society we cannot afford to have these
amazing tools so abused and underused this is not going
to hold so the only way forward that i see
is that we need to build a responsible path towards
psychedelic use and it cannot merely be a clinical path
it cannot just be that psychedelics in the future are
used only to cure ptsd and depression it must be
that there is a path towards the highest metaphysical understanding
towards the highest spiritual realizations to the highest stages of
human development there must be that path with psychedelics and
someone has to pioneer that path there are others out
there who are pioneering that path i'm not the only
one but i feel it's my responsibility since i have
this information and knowledge and platform is to help establish
that path especially because a lot of people on this
path or in this field rather i should say do
it rather irresponsibly or they do it in a sort
of a limited way where again they're using it they're
not using it to reach the highest metaphysical understanding they're
using it to justify their little you know shamanic practice
or their you know ayahuasca world view mother ayahuasca something
like that but what i'm talking about is actually like
a non-dual path through psychedelics that doesn't mean it excludes
other practices my version of this path includes those other
practices but it just adds this extra dimension of psychedelics
on top of it and to me that's sort of
the best of both worlds and to me that's how
i see spirituality being done in the future but someone
has to invent that and more than just invent it
because i'm not saying i'm the first person who's like
done this not at all many people have come before
me and i'm in a sense i'm standing on the
shoulders of giants you know terence mckenna and um james
auroch you know he popularized five admin team martin ball
uh uh there there are many influential people in the
psychedelic community uh you know alexander shulgin so they all
deserve their credit but it's not just about inventing it
or being the first it's also about popularizing it because
really what we're talking about here is changing culture changing
how society at large views these things and it's also
about using it to really truly go towards direct non-duality
which like wasn't the case for example with terence mckenna
as as amazing as some of the terence mckenna literature
is and some of his quotes and some of his
sayings you know he's sort of idolized in the psychedelic
community um that's all great but the bottom line is
that he didn't really understand nonduality he didn't really teach
non-dual he didn't connect the psychedelics with the non-duality um
and a lot of people who who do psychedelics or
teach psychedelics they don't really connect it to the to
the highest purest metaphysical understanding they don't connect with epistemology
they might not connect it with developmental psychology and other
things like this and so i feel like i'm in
a position where i can do that or at least
to play a role in that and so that's the
role that i'm playing and it is very important to
me to make sure that any of you who are
going to be following that path i'm going to expect
you to be ridiculously responsible about how you're doing that
and if i see that any of you are doing
this in an irresponsible manner with a bunch of zen
devilry and abuse and misuse and harm to self and
to others and crazy antics and other things like this
um i'm going to denounce you and i'm going to
have i'm going to refuse to have anything to do
with you i'm going to kick you off the forum
i'm going to i'm going to boot you from my
comment section because i'm not going to tolerate that because
there's a larger gain that we're playing here and your
zen devilry is not going to fly right so just
be responsible be conscious and in the future i'm excited
to share some of my um amazing discoveries in this
field i have not shared everything yet that i've discovered
there's a lot of amazing stuff here so stay tuned
for that you
