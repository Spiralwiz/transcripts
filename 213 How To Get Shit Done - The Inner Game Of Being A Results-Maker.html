            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/RiOZHpPd2v8' target='_blank'>How To Get Shit Done - The Inner Game Of Being A Results-Maker</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Living in a fantasy bubble</b>: Leo Gura describes a phenomenon of many people living in a "fantasy bubble", detached from the real world. These individuals often have big dreams and ideas but struggle to translate them into reality. This discrepancy becomes evident when faced with real-world responsibilities. Successful people, in contrast, are able to adapt their beliefs and dreams to align with the practical realities of life.
</li><li><b>Doing the necessary "dirty work"</b>: Achieving dreams and goals often requires going through a difficult process which Gura terms as the "dirty work". This includes facing the reality that some ideas and beliefs that one holds may not work and adapting to this realization. For example, adjusting prices if the market is unwilling to pay the expected price for a product or service. Understanding this aspect is crucial to making dreams a reality.
</li><li><b>Facing the challenge of turning intentions into results</b>: Gura introduces the concept of Stage Green, a level of psychological development characterized by idealism and strong concern for the world. Individuals in this stage tend to struggle with translating their good intentions into real-world results. Success in areas like spirituality and relationships requires actual action and tangible results, not just talking about it.
</li><li><b>Understanding and embodying spiritual concepts</b>: People often talk about challenging concepts like spirituality and relationships but fail to put these into action. Gura emphasizes the importance of understanding and embodying spiritual concepts to make actual progress, rather than using them as a distraction.
</li><li><b>Tangible results versus merely doing things</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of achieving actual, tangible results. Talking about making changes such as moving to another country, losing weight, improving relationships carries no weight unless it leads to tangible results. 
</li><li><b>Importance of valuing tangible results</b>: Gura encourages viewing life as a series of projects with specific goals that need to be accomplished within set timelines. He believes that creating tangible things is crucial to measuring success.
</li><li><b>Taking personal responsibility for achieving goals</b>: Leo emphasizes on not depending on others for achieving goals. He encourages viewers to take personal responsibility to get work done and cautions against only taking care for their own comfort.
</li><li><b>Avoiding shortcuts and investing in self-growth</b>: Gura emphasizes the importance of consistent effort and hard work in achieving success. He stresses on the importance of being willing to change oneself, developing skills and knowledge, avoiding dogmatic thinking, and embracing harsh realities for personal growth.
</li><li><b>Understanding the realities of starting a business and marketplace</b>: Gura underscores the importance of understanding the realities of the marketplace when starting a business. He shares that many times, people are unwilling to pay for products or services, and these realities have to be embraced and learned from. 
</li><li><b>Just consuming information isn't enough</b>: Gura urges viewers to take action rather than just consuming his videos. He recommends an action-to-learning ratio of 10 to 1.
</li><li><b>Shift from Dreamer to Results-Maker</b>: Leo Gura discusses his personal transition from being a dreamer in his early years to becoming a dedicated results-maker post-college. He explains that wanting to accomplish his dreams necessitated doing the emotionally difficult and "dirty" work of turning these dreams into reality.
</li><li><b>Adjustment of Beliefs for Reality</b>: He acknowledges that the transformation process involves being humble and flexible enough to let go of personal fantasies and beliefs that do not align with reality, which can be emotionally painful and challenging. This includes confronting the failure of an idea and revising it rather than retreating into more fantasizing.
</li><li><b>Embrace Reality and Challenges</b>: Moreover, one must repeatedly assess one's beliefs about the world and adjust them based on whether they aid or hinder the project's real-world application. The embrace of reality can lead to personal growth, maturity, evolution, and the relinquishing of old dogmas.
</li><li><b>Stage Green Individuals</b>: Leo discusses the concept of "Stage Green" individuals who, despite their wide-reaching concerns and good intentions, often fail to generate tangible results. Rather than taking action, they usually engage in talks about peace, harmony, and love but do not significantly impact the real world.
</li><li><b>Implementing Spirituality and Relationships</b>: He emphasizes that even areas of life like spirituality and relationships, often associated with non-tangibility, require tangible results-making for successful practical implementation. Using spiritual concepts as a distraction rather than embodying them can lead to a lack of genuine spiritual growth. 
</li><li><b>Need for Personal Development</b>: He highlights that developing and maintaining high-quality relationships requires personal growth and development. Furthermore, becoming a bona fide results maker and self-actualizing requires a person to face reality, be willing to make sacrifices, and be prepared for harsh realities. 
</li><li><b>Crucial Role of Results-Makers</b>: Finally, Leo underlines the vital role that results makers play in translating dreams into reality. One must acknowledge the significance of this role to work towards their dreams sincerely.
</li><li><b>Concept of giving up cherished beliefs</b>: Leo Gura suggests that true progress might require you to give up cherished beliefs and confront the harsh realities of how things like money, economy, politics, and relationships actually work.
</li><li><b>Facing reality in intimate relationships</b>: Leo states that intimate relationships are not based on unconditional love but are often more like business negotiations. He advocates for the putting the effort required to work within this reality and eventually transcend it.
</li><li><b>Taking action</b>: Leo advises viewers to shun empty talk and take concrete actions towards their goals. He emphasizes the importance of 'doing' rather than 'talking' about things like starting a business, improving finances, moving countries, or seeking personal enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Result-oriented actions</b>: Leo distinguishes between 'doing stuff' and 'getting results', warning viewers against the trap of being stuck in cycles of activity that do not generate real results. He advocates for a swift change in approach if current actions do not yield outcomes.
</li><li><b>Importance of tangible results</b>: Leo recognizes that while there is more to life than results, most people lack a 'results-making mentality', which he considers critical for success. He suggests viewing life as a series of projects with specific, tangible outcomes.
</li><li><b>Honoring commitments</b>: Leo identifies the need to hold oneself and those around them, including employers and employees, to the standard of creating tangible results. He sees life as a continuous pattern of setting and achieving concrete goals.
</li><li><b>Impactful work</b>: Leo links the desire to impact people and change the world to being a results-maker. For people with such a purpose, tangible results are not just an individual achievement but a broader contribution to society.
</li><li><b>On cheap talk and action</b>: Leo discourages talk without concrete action and cautions against the tendency of people to talk about grand plans while taking no real steps towards actualizing these plans. 
</li><li><b>Taking responsibility</b>: Leo calls for taking personal responsibility for creating tangible results, without relying on others. In accomplishing this, one needs to focus not on mere survival, but on positively impacting the world around them.
</li><li><b>Discounting Talk</b>: Leo dismisses talk without action as entirely meaningless, emphasizing that intentions hold no weight unless followed up by concrete results. He encourages individuals to take action before discussing their plans.
</li><li><b>Value of Excellence</b>: Leo highlights the importance of striving for excellence in every undertaking. Whether it's working for oneself or for others, he believes an individual should always aim to deliver high-quality work, regardless of the circumstances.
</li><li><b>Personal Responsibility</b>: Emphasizing the importance of taking personal responsibility, Leo highlights the importance of proactive rather than reactive actions. He warns against waiting for others to take initiative and encourages adopting a mindset of self-reliance to achieve targets and goals.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Big Picture</b>: Leo stresses on the significance of a results maker having a high-level understanding of the big picture and working towards it with a purpose, rather than just engaging in menial labor for monetary benefits.
</li><li><b>Strong Work Ethic</b>: Leo cites the importance of a strong work ethic, which he views as undervalued in modern, comfortable society. He encourages adopting a willingness to use brute force to achieve desired results when necessary.
</li><li><b>Sacrificing Comfort</b>: To achieve meaningful results, Leo believes one has to often sacrifice personal comfort. This could mean giving up vacations or working late, but it's necessary for progress and success.
</li><li><b>Willingness to Change</b>: The willingness to change oneself is a fundamental concept Leo believes in. This could involve not just building technical skills or acquiring knowledge, but also changing one's entire psyche, paradigm, belief systems, and worldview to achieve desired results. 
</li><li><b>Open-Mindedness</b>: Leo underlines the importance of being open-minded and avoiding dogmatic thinking for personal growth and generating excellent results. He emphasizes that not having an open mind will limit an individual's potential and ability to generate the best results.
</li><li><b>Aligning with Harsh Truths</b>: Leo Gura recommends making alignment with reality, whatever the emotional cost, a guiding principle in life. He believes this strategy ultimately pays off.
</li><li><b>Throwing Yourself into Demanding Situations</b>: Gura proposes challenging oneself by stepping outside of comfort zones, comparing the process to military boot camp which forces rapid transformation.
</li><li><b>Surrounding Yourself with Exceptional People</b>: He suggests surrounding oneself with people who achieve notable results. Such association elevates personal expectations and ignites possibility.
</li><li><b>Starting a Business to Get Results</b>: Gura highlights the invaluable reality check and personal growth that starting a business can provide. He reflects on his own experience, how the struggle of starting a business forced him to fundamentally understand the marketplace and take full responsibility.
</li><li><b>Thinking About Your Own Death</b>: Gura finds regular contemplation of mortality a powerful motivator. It highlights the limited time available to achieve goals, resulting in a keen focus on producing results.
</li><li><b>Taking Action</b>: Gura emphasizes the importance of taking action rather than being overly consumed with learning theory. He advises adopting a 10 to 1 ratio of acting versus consuming personal development content.
</li><li><b>Life Purpose Course</b>: He introduces his comprehensive life purpose course as a tool for achieving extraordinary results, believing that successful alignment with one's life purpose is pinnacle of life satisfaction.
</li><li><b>Exploring Resources on Actualized.org</b>: The array of resources available on actualized.org is highlighted, including a newsletter, exclusive content, a book list, and the aforementioned life purpose course.
