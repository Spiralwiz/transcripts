[Music] what is spirituality I want to explore this question
especially from the perspective of someone who is scientifically minded
rationally minded atheistic and would otherwise consider spirituality to be
something woowoo and something irrational and something not worthy of
serious study or consideration you know I was that way
not too long ago as little as five years ago
if I saw a video or a book that mentioned
spirituality I would immediately skip on to the next thing
because in my mind I knew the spirituality was just
a label for this entire domain of fantastical and imaginary
things which don't really exist which have nothing to do
with science and rationality and therefore not worthy of serious
consideration so I just skip it I was very averse
to this word in fact I hated this word for
a very long time for most of my life until
I did more personal development work and things changed for
me and I realized what spirituality really means and so
I want to help you to wrap your mind around
that so this is the no [ __ ] guy
to spirituality why does the word spirituality exist at all
what is it pointing to this word is pointing to
something and it's pointing to something more than just a
fictional realm of fairy tale creatures and biblical stories that's
not quite what spirituality is in fact I hated this
word spirituality so much that when I went through life
coach training around five years ago and I graduated I
got my certificate and I started to coach clients one-on-one
start and make a little bit of money doing that
and one of the first tools or assessments that they
give you when you go through this Coast training is
called the Wheel of Life and I would give this
tool to new clients that I took on and basically
it was just a simple assessment to help clients understand
where they are in their life and maybe where they
need some more work in their life some more personal
development work and the way it worked was there like
eight spokes on this wheel each spoke corresponding to a
different domain or facet of someone's life so it might
include family relationships sexuality maybe career business health and fitness
yada yada yada and finally there was one spoke called
spirituality I didn't like the word or concept of spirituality
so much that I actually created my own wheel of
life where I removed the spirituality spoke and replaced it
with something else so that's how much I didn't like
this word I was very averse because I was an
atheist for most of my life so what does spirituality
really mean a much better word and in fact I
wish I had used this word in my past episodes
more is metaphysics metaphysics metaphysics is actually synonymous and identical
with spirituality these are the same pursuit of course most
people don't understand that this is the same pursuit and
of course metaphysics itself has taken on a lot of
negative connotations in the way that spirituality has so for
an atheistic aliy minded rationally minded scientifically minded person the
word spirituality has a negative connotation in the sense that
it's referring to an imaginary domain of wishful thinking and
the word metaphysics also has a negative connotation because science
split itself off from metaphysics maybe two or three hundred
years ago historically speaking in the West and so now
when a scientist hears the word metaphysics in their mind
that refers to all sorts of abstract speculations about things
which are unempioyed in which you can't possibly know and
so that also supposedly refers to some imaginary domain of
things that can't be tested or falsified and therefore have
no practical value and are of no value to serious
scientific inquiry now this is a very wrong notion of
what metaphysics is that's not what metaphysics is what metaphysics
really is is an investigation into the fundamental nature of
existence and what differentiates metaphysics from science is that science
actually stays mostly on the surface it questions physical phenomena
and it tries to go out there and measure it
and to quantify it and to put it into forms
of equations and theories and so forth and that's all
good there's nothing wrong with that but metaphysics is something
deeper metaphysics is actually asking about the substance of things
it's asking about what things really are it's asking questions
like why does existence exists why is there something rather
than nothing where did it come from and how could
it have even arisen in the first place and what
is energy what is matter what are atoms what are
quarks if those are the things you think the universe
is made out of or what is information what is
it really not an equation don't give me an equation
what is it really what is the equation what is
the thought what is the brain what is the body
what does matter what is physicality what is time what
is space they're really deep questions now the mistake people
make the mistake many scientifically-minded people make is they think
well Leo that's all nice and good you can sit
around and navel gaze all you want and you can
philosophize til the cows come home but you'll never answer
any of these questions really because these are meaningless questions
sure they're entertaining to think about sometimes I like to
think about them but really nobody can answer these questions
human beings have been asking these questions for thousands of
years we haven't made any progress and there's no empirical
way to answer these questions and so therefore they're not
objective questions they're not within the domain of science and
so we shouldn't take them seriously it's just a waste
of time but notice that that position right there is
actually a truth claim and moreover it's a it's a
claim you're making without actually having done the inquiry so
actually what you're doing is you're making a none empirical
unscientific claim when you dismiss metaphysics because to actually truly
be able to say that metaphysics is useless and that
it cannot be resolved what you would actually have to
do if you wanted to be scientific and empirical is
you would have to go and explore every single corner
of the universe and every single thought everything every single
philosophical system every single tool that's out there you'd have
to explore all of that and only after that if
you failed to make any progress only then could you
perhaps conclude in a scientific and empirical way that metaphysics
is not worth your time only then only after you've
scoured the entire universe but of course those people who
denounced metaphysics have never even bothered to take any of
these questions very seriously let alone have scoured the entire
universe looking for answers so already noticed that already there's
a deep contradiction in trying to dismiss matific metaphysics from
a scientific perspective because the dismissal itself is unscientific and
unimpaired chol the truth is you don't know whether metaphysics
is really worth your time or whether these questions can
be resolved who knows maybe they can be you don't
know until you've actually explored it so spirituality contrary to
what many people think is not religion and it's not
fairy tales and myths and this sort of stuff it's
actually metaphysics it's a very serious pursuit it's the deeper
pursuit than science now again if to be very careful
here and make sure that you don't conflate spirituality with
religion it's a very common trap that scientifically-minded people fall
into there are many problems with religion I am no
fan or defender of religion there's a lot of corruption
in it and a lot of falsehood and a lot
of delusion in it but that does not mean that
it's the same thing as spirituality or metaphysics here's an
initial stab at defining what metaphysics is metaphysis or sorry
well spirituality the same thing really what spirit what spirituality
is it's developing a deep metaphysical connection to reality developing
a deep metaphysical connection to reality but what does that
mean you might think Oh Leo you're just being airy-fairy
and wishy-washy here and saying nice platitudes but what does
it really mean to develop a deep metaphysical connection to
reality well I'll tell you exactly what it means I
mean a very specific thing the problem though is to
get you to understand what I mean because the whole
problem with spirituality and metaphysics is that we are talking
about abstract things things which are not commonly experienced by
most people living a mundane ordinary life so we're sort
of going outside the domain of ordinary experience and that
makes it difficult to talk about but because our entire
language and our entire culture mostly talks about things that
are within our mundane domains of experience so what I
really mean by this deep metaphysical connection is I mean
a connection to the wonder of existence itself to the
wonder of nature and actually if you're a fan of
science and you're a fan of deep inquiry empirical inquiry
to the nature of reality then you should be actually
quite familiar with this sense of wonder that I'm talking
about let me give you some examples for example when
you're out in nature perhaps at a national park and
you're looking at some beautiful sunset over the mountains and
it's amazing it's wonderful and during that moment your consciousness
feels like it's elevated and you feel this sense of
wonder I don't just mean a feeling a good feeling
or a good emotion I mean something deeper I mean
that you're actually connecting to the profundity of a distance
itself and also to its beauty but again not in
a superficial way of like oh that's a beautiful picture
but I mean you're connecting to something within existence itself
that strikes you as beautiful as awesome as wondrous as
mysterious you connect to it or when you look up
at the stars and if you're scientifically minded you know
how many stars there are you know the estimates you
know how many billions of galaxies and billions of star
systems and billions of planets and all of this and
you think about that as you're looking up at the
sky and it just gives you a sense of awe
and wonder and again which are connecting to there is
that metaphysical connection of profundity you're starting to sense that
there's something about existence which is way deeper than we
conventionally talk about or think about in our everyday lives
or for example if you're looking at the beauty of
biology like if you're looking at a cell under a
microscope and you look at that and you wonder and
you think my god look at what's going on in
that cell it's incredible the complexity of it the beauty
of it or maybe you're looking at some physics formulas
or some mathematical equations and the beauty of it strikes
you the way that it does many physicists and mathematicians
or you're looking at some art some fine art in
a museum or whatever strikes your fancy and you can't
you connect with the beauty of that or maybe even
perhaps with the beauty of music of a really well
composed artistic type of song or tune or even those
of you who are video gamers out there you know
you ever pick up a video game that you've been
waiting for for a long time it's one of these
epic triple-a titles some sort of massive open world RPG
next generation amazing graphics amazing everything and you pop that
thing in and you're you're looking through this world you're
inside this game world for the first five or ten
minutes and it's like amazing graphics amazing details amazing physics
amazing art amazing everything you're just kind of walking through
this new universe and you're looking at it all and
it's breathtaking it's amazing that's more than just a game
that's happening there again what's happening is that you're somehow
connecting to something deeper something more beautiful more profound and
that's the whole appeal of playing those types of games
or sometimes maybe you go to one of those epic
movies I know I get this when I go to
an epic movie I don't go to movies that often
anymore but when I did when I was younger I
would go to a movie like I'm thinking something like
Braveheart one of these you know epic or war movies
maybe Saving Private Ryan or something like that and you
watch the whole film and the beauty of one of
these type of films is that it puts you after
you walk out of the theater puts you in a
certain state of mind it gets you thinking about the
human condition and what's really going on and why are
we here and how does it work like this and
why is there so much suffering in the world and
this source of stuff or maybe one of these kind
of twisted movies like The Matrix with [ __ ]
with your mind and [ __ ] with your sense
of reality or a movie like Inception you know these
kinds of movies they put you in a certain frame
of mind that's what I'm talking about for those next
30 minutes as you're walking out of the movie theater
you have that metaphysical connection or maybe you're a fan
of space exploration maybe you're into NASA and you're into
following all the latest NASA news how they're sending up
satellites and Rovers to different planets and you're looking at
the pictures that are being sent back for Mars and
from the different asteroids that are being explored and all
of that maybe you even have dreams sometimes of flying
out into space like some of these millionaires and billionaires
like to do and maybe you watch one of these
space movies where you see someone flying through space and
you see some beautiful Vista of the planet Earth and
it's amazing and you look down upon the earth and
you see oh my God look where look at where
mankind has come in the last few thousand years and
it's it's incredible that feeling of wonder with being in
space why are we so interested in space travel as
a race precisely because it connects us to something higher
within us humanity then sees itself not just as a
as a bunch of ants running around on the planet
trying to survive try to [ __ ] eat and
kill each other but there's something more to life right
there's something higher and in fact that's why people become
astronauts that's why people work really hard to become scientists
they work for decades they work for decades to becoming
astronauts and they're they're really serious about this because that's
why they became a scientist in the first place because
there's something about the pursuit of understanding which is essentially
what science is its investigation of reality to understand what
it really is but you know there's sort of like
shallow levels of science and deeper levels of science the
deeper levels of signs are the ones that actually connect
you with this deep metaphysical spiritual connection and of course
many scientists would admit this but now here is where
they make the mistake is they say Oh leo well
you're right I mean you're right I do have this
emotional connection to my scientific work and I do I
do wonder about the Stars and I do enjoy the
sunsets and all this and you know I am a
human being I'm not a robot but Leo I mean
in the end aren't these just feelings isn't that what
you're talking about yeah the sense of mystery and awe
sure scientists get it but why why are you now
jumping to spirituality there's no spirits here where where's the
spirit in all this here's the thing what you're experiencing
in all these examples that I gave you is you're
experiencing a point zero zero zero zero one percent dilution
of true spirituality it's a little taste a tiny tiny
tiny tiny taste like if you took one little grain
of sugar and you dropped it on your tongue and
you barely felt something that's what you're getting there and
what true spirituality is is really cranking up that connection
until you got a really strong stream of it hitting
you all the time such that it can no longer
be ignored and it's not something that happens to you
randomly accidentally sporadically because if you're honest for most people
even for scientists and so forth even for philosophical people
this kind of metaphysical connection that I was talking about
with these various examples it happens very rarely it happens
like less than 1% of your life like way less
it happens point point zero zero zero zero zero one
percent like extremely rare maybe maybe a handful of times
throughout the year you experience this but most of the
time you're just utterly sucked into mundane ordinary dull grindy
experience of everyday life and what I'm telling you spirituality
is about it's about taking that little minuscule amount of
this connection that you get and amplifying it such that
you feel it all the time such that you're always
connected to the profundity of existence without having to rely
on any kind of external stimulation like a particular beautiful
sunset or some movie or some new video game or
something you see in a biology class under a microscope
right because those are rare experiences you can't maintain them
all the time but the fact is that you do
exist so it is actually possible to develop this connection
to the profundity of your existence at all times of
course the rationalists the scientists here will still be very
adamant and deny that what I'm saying here is of
any real significance and they will say leo but I
mean I hear you but aren't you just kind of
romanticizing this aren't you just talking about emotions and feelings
what does this have to do with reality this has
nothing to do with the truth this has nothing to
do with with you know the hard facts these are
just feelings and surely oh I mean you could I
grant you you could delude yourself with all sorts of
fantastical ideas about your connection to physical reality and sure
I even grant you Leela you could make yourself feel
happier and and better and and maybe maybe you'll enjoy
your life more but it's not gonna be true you're
just filling your mind with all sorts of ideas and
all you're doing is like positive wishful thinking and what
I care about is the truth the hard objective truth
which has nothing to do with feelings nothing to do
with with with Wonder and awe and magic and mystery
no no no it's just hard facts man hard facts
like give me a spreadsheet of hard logical facts and
and I'll be good and I don't care how I
feel about it but of course this is extremely myopic
what you're saying here because your life is utterly utterly
utterly governed by your feelings not by facts and in
fact your insistence on facts over feelings is itself grounded
in feelings not facts you see everything you do in
your life is utterly controlled by your feelings including your
pursuit of science and your insistence on rationality you are
irrational about your insistence and clinging to rationality that's the
irony of what you're doing this deep metaphysical connection sure
it manifests itself as a feeling but you have to
look at where the feeling is coming from and why
is the rising in the first place and that has
nothing to do with feelings or sentimentality that has to
do with how conscious you are of the ultimate truth
of reality and answering these various metaphysical existential questions the
more conscious you become the more amazed you become at
just what reality and existence are and that is what
fills you with this sense of awe and profundity and
that's the reason why when you're doing scientific aspects pleurae
ssin if you're mathematician and you're exploring there is formulas
if you're physicist and you're studying various formulas it's when
you really probe the nature of reality deeply with your
mind that you start to have insights and these insights
are what give you that sense of of beauty and
profundity and those insights that is you approaching closer and
closer to the absolute truth so what spirituality is about
it's not about filling your mind with fantastical ideas it's
actually the exact opposite of that it's removing all the
ideas you presently have about reality questioning them so much
that you deconstruct everything that you think and believe reality
is until what you're left with is the raw objective
so to speak truth and that is what blows your
mind and what you discover is that actually the reason
I wasn't awed by reality this whole time but only
though during those rare moments was because my mind was
filled with all sorts of garbage ideas for example like
the idea of facts over feelings the idea of an
objective external reality the idea of materiality and various other
metaphysical presumptions that materialist science makes it's because I had
all of those beliefs that were blocking me from the
truth when you really get to the truth it's gonna
be extremely profound and it's gonna shock and awe you
and while you're sitting there and you're pooh-poohing all this
and saying all the others are just feelings that's actually
you filling your mind with fantastical ideas so it's exactly
the opposite of what you think it is and spirituality
is about developing this connection have you ever done philosophical
inquiry this is the appeal of philosophy to is to
do this inquiry into the nature of things and it
can be profound it doesn't have to be religious or
spiritual per se you can just do philosophical inquiry and
the reason that's appealing to you if it is is
because you're connecting with the profundity of existence in one
fashion or another these are little hints and clues the
problem is that people misunderstand what these clues are really
pointing to they think that uh just some feelings bla
bla bla no these are just the tips of some
giant icebergs that you can go track down and spirituality
is about tracking those down to the very bottom to
see what there is and that certainly puts a different
perspective on spirituality doesn't it all the sudden spirituality is
not about worshipping somebody reading some Bible praying to some
God thinking about some man sitting up in the clouds
or any of this nonsense it's not about going to
church it's not about rituals any of this it's about
deep metaphysical questioning and connection to reality philosophy really is
equivalent to spirituality these two are really identical in the
West a lot of modern academic philosophers have completely lost
touch with this they forgot that the aim of philosophy
was actually truth with a capital T the search for
the absolute the answer to what is reality why does
it exist how come there is something rather than nothing
how is knowledge possible what is the substance of everything
what is time with a space and so forth this
is the essence of philosophy not writing papers and debating
about technical academic minutia and there's a long rich history
of philosophers who have undertaken this enquire and have actually
arrived at the absolute I'm talking about people like anaxagoras
Anaximander Heraclitus Socrates Pierrot Epictetus platanus Spinoza Bishop Berkeley Hegel
and others and then we're just talking about the Western
philosophical tradition here that's a small list what do all
these people have in common well basically they were all
idealists not materialist idealism is spirituality idealism is what connects
you to the ultimate nature of existence of course not
idealism as a philosophy and his idea but as an
actual connection so that's the next thing that people misunderstand
about philosophy about metaphysics and about spirituality is that they
think that all it is is just beliefs Leo you're
just filling your mind with beliefs and making yourself feel
good no no no no no you don't understand it's
the opposite you're removing all your beliefs by removing the
beliefs that's what's connecting you more and more to the
metaphysical nature of the truth the truth is not accessed
through beliefs it's accessed directly because it's the truth it's
the truth therefore it exists so it is accessible a
mistake that many materialists again make is that they think
that Leo the truth can't be accessed directly yeah we
can have formulas and models about it but we can't
access it directly after all we're human beings and we
have a perceptual system we have a brain and a
mind and so therefore that's creating various kinds of distortions
and delusions and so we never have direct access to
the truth after all how would you possibly know if
you ever did come upon the truth but again watch
out because that's an assumption you can't know whether the
truth is directly accessible or not until you make a
serious effort at accessing it and if you do what
you'll discover is that it actually is and that's something
that a lot of philosophers in Western in the West
intellectual tradition have misunderstood for example cot Emanuel can't make
a distinction between new mana and phenomena and he said
that we can access phenomena but we can't access the
noumenon the noumenon is the truth in and of itself
it's like we have access to appearances Bollea we don't
have access to the absolute truth yes we do but
it takes some work and it's tricky and it's counterintuitive
it means you have to go beyond beliefs you have
to go beyond symbols you have to go beyond models
and maps you have to go beyond science beyond math
and asks where spirituality comes in that's what spiritual practice
is about so philosophy especially modern philosophies a little tricky
it's pretty corrupted just like religion of course religion is
very corrupted and of course many spiritual teachings are also
very corrupted so corruption abounds so don't say that all
spirituality I don't want to do spirituality because there's a
lot of corruption in it no no no that's just
the nature of how the mind works when it comes
to the truth the mind is a really hard time
grasping what the absolute truth is so it gets corrupted
extremely easily now let me give you some alternative definitions
for spirituality let's hit it from multiple perspectives because there's
a lot of different ways to look at it and
then you'll get a sort of a a synthetic compound
perspective from multiple angles so it's developing a metaphysical connection
with reality we said that it's also answering questions about
the nature of existence we've also sort of said that
it's also seeking of truth with a capital T if
what you did right now is you committed the rest
of your life to seeking the absolute ultimate truth directly
independent of all belief systems and all ideologies that would
be the most spiritual act you could take that is
the essence of spirituality right there never mind how you
do it just if you made that commitment that would
be a spiritual path that is like the pinnacle the
quintessence of the spiritual path spirituality is also having a
personal union with the truth you could think of it
as making love to reality having sex with reality that's
literally what it is and that is the whole appeal
of the spiritual path that's why people become monks and
meta physicians if they do is because see most people
who are so preoccupied with mundane life they think that
the best life they can live is to go out
there eat great food travel around run a business or
a bunch of money and have sex with the hottest
people they can the monk in the metaphysician though is
a lot smarter a lot wiser so what he says
he says you know what I'm gonna reject all that
[ __ ] that I don't care about that what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and have sex
with reality directly why go through middlemen I don't need
middlemen I don't need money I don't need a business
I don't need women I don't need any of that
I don't need fast cars all that is distraction let
me go [ __ ] reality directly let me go
have sex with the absolute truth and so you go
do that and then you actually end up realizing that
it's possible to have sex with the absolute truth you
make love to it with your mind you actually penetrate
it with the mind or rather it penetrates you in
the mind and that is real sex you don't know
what real sex is until you've had metaphysical sex and
then you're in such ecstasy when you're having this metaphysical
sex that everything else becomes ridiculous it becomes pathetic it
becomes worthless compared to the value that you get from
this activity union with the truth personal direct union with
the absolute that's real spirituality how do you do that
well we'll get there in a minute speaking of which
when we're on the topic of sex here this is
a really good analogy because for a lot of rashly
mind scientifically minded people atheistic we mounted people they just
can't understand what it means to have sex with the
truth so think of it this way imagine that you
this rationalist that you think you are that you'd like
to proclaim that you are try to explain to me
let's say I've never had sex and you try to
explain to me why I should have sex and you
tell me look Leo there's this amazing thing called an
orgasm it's amazing you got to have it you got
to try this this is really worth your time to
check this out and I uh I'm an even more
rational person let's say than you are I'm extremely rational
I'm extremely hard-nosed and really grounded in the facts and
what I tell you is well look orgasm what is
this I've never never had any orgasm what What nonsense
are you talking about orgasm this is this is fairy
tales fairy tales and nonsense that you made-up wishful thinking
look at how emotional you are look at how romantic
you are I just care about the facts man I'm
an objective and hard-nosed person there's no such thing as
orgasms give me a double-blind study that tells me what
an orgasm is until you do that I don't care
about your orgasms I'm not gonna take them seriously how
would you convince me that an orgasm is a real
thing that's worth my while to pursue and to experience
you see you see how you're not rational at all
you're utterly irrational there's nothing rational about you having sex
with people pursuing orgasms why are you doing it you're
utterly irrational there's nothing rational about sex there's a certain
rational to earning money there's nothing rational about having a
sports car what the [ __ ] are you doing
in your life everything you do in your life is
utterly irrational run by feelings and emotions and then what
you have is you have a little sprinkling of pretense
of rationality on top of that which is complete horseshit
and it's utterly irrational what you're doing because you're not
even aware of the fact that you're being irrational it
would be much more rational for you to admit that
you're irrational then to keep pretending that you're so sort
of rational [ __ ] you know objective truth seeker
that's not what you are stop playing that [ __
] game so spirituality is like that so in the
case of an orgasm what you would do if you
wanted to convince me of an orgasm you say go
have sex experience the orgasm and see for yourself and
then I would say but why would I do that
these are just ideas and beliefs and you would say
no no no no no an orgasm is not an
idea and it's not a belief and sex is not
a belief and it's not a fantasy this is something
you can do and then something will result from that
and that thing is an amazing thing don't try it
and I would say ah no why would I try
that these are just states in the brain just chemicals
in the brain who cares I'll just go do drugs
if I want joy why would I have an orgasm
you see you see what with this hyper rationalist position
leads to the absurdity of it the myopia of it
the stupidity of it everything that you know in reality
anything you cherish anything you value is grounded in experience
and what spirituality means what metaphysics is is an entirely
new domain of experiences along the lines of orgasms which
you have never had nor have any of your friends
or family members or anyone that you've ever interacted with
for the most part therefore they are difficult to talk
about and difficult to convince you of simply because orgasms
everyone's had them and everyone knows them and they're also
sort of biologically easily programmed into you at adolescence and
so you have them very easily and so there's no
doubt about them whereas spiritual experiences these take work and
that's why it's a little bit harder to explain to
people what spirituality is it's very easy to explain to
people what sex is also because you can show people
a video of two people having sex and that will
immediately excite them and that's because there's the biological mechanism
there which is very very sticky which which which gets
you excited about it with spiritual truths and pursuits a
little harder I can't show you a video of the
incredible mind-blowing mystical insights that I've had into the nature
of reality can't show you a video of it can
hardly put it into words it's such a mind-blowing thing
and because of that it's very difficult to communicate it
alright let's move on to other perspectives to other definitions
in spirituality it can also be defined as the raising
of consciousness that's what it is you're expanding your consciousness
beyond your ordinary consciousness that you're doing the consciousness that
you use ordinary consciousness is specifically tuned by evolution so
that you are constantly just fulfilling your basic survival needs
that's what it's tuned for including if you're doing science
including if you're doing math and even if you're doing
philosophy academics sorts of philosophy you're still basically in the
exact same frame of consciousness as ordinary people as the
guy walking down the street begging for quarters that's your
level of consciousness but there are additional degrees and stages
of consciousness which go radically higher and higher and higher
and from there you experience reality in a radically different
way so to be spiritual is to be pursuing the
raising of your consciousness another way to look at spirituality
is that it's the realization that reality is a mind
and not a physical system it's a mental system this
is the essence of idealism everything that's happening around you
right now look around the room this is all mind
stuff mental phenomena there is nothing within reality but mental
phenomena not phenomena that's happening in the brain no I
mean mental phenomena with no brain when you realize that
everything that's ever happened in your life and everything that's
happening to you right now is a purely mental phenomenon
a construction of your own mind including the physical wall
including everything that you think is real when you realize
that all of that is a mental construction of your
own mind that's when things get really interesting that's when
a lot of new possibilities open up for you that
weren't possible before under the dualistic materialistic paradigm again this
is not a belief that you program yourself with as
though I'm standing here believing that this is all the
mind because I've programmed myself with that because somehow is
supposed to make me feel better no it's the exact
opposite what I've actually done is I've removed all my
materialistic beliefs which have been telling me that this is
a material system I've removed all those or I've rather
deconstructed them such that now I can stand here and
be conscious of the fact that this is all happening
inside my mind a projection of my own mind and
that is a very liberating thing because when you think
reality is a dumb physical system then there's all sorts
of inherent limitations to reality you think reality has to
behave in a certain physical way and it can't be
any other way but when you realize that all of
that was just a belief and that you don't need
to believe that anymore then you start to see oh
without that belief now all the sudden reality becomes a
lot more fluid a lot more flexible all sorts of
weird stuff could happen that I didn't expect and precisely
because reality is a mind what I tend to think
tends to create my own reality so if I tend
to think that reality is a physical system that's what
I'll experience and if I start to remove that belief
and now I begin to just open myself up to
various kinds of possibilities I'm extremely radically open-minded now all
the sudden I can start to experience non-physical things things
that normally people would think our woowoo they now become
real because hey guess what this was a mind all
the time you were always in a mind but you
were in a mind thinking you were inside of a
physical box and so because of that you were inside
of a physical box because that's what the mind does
is whatever the mind believes is what gets created that's
what creation is that's what reality is it's the mental
construction so from this paradigm it's a very different paradigm
from the scientific materialistic paradigm this is the spiritual paradigm
from this paradigm now things become a lot more interesting
and a lot more fluid now it's recognized that your
mind plays a very important role in the construction of
physical reality whereas before this was denied another way to
define spirituality is that it's the realization that reality is
irreducibly fundamentally mystical the problem with materialists and scientists and
atheists is that they just assume and this is just
an assumption it's all it is it's a completely groundless
assumption they assume that reality is not mystical there's nothing
mystical about it and in fact if we see anything
mystical within reality our job is to demystify it that's
the job of most scientists and this is precisely backwards
when you're de mystifying reality all you're really doing is
you're tricking yourself into not seeing the irreducible mystical nature
of existence you're actually breaking and severing that connection with
that metaphysical connection with existence and you're lying to yourself
to do it of course you tell yourself that you're
doing it in the name of objective truth but actually
that whole spiel about in the name of objective truth
all of that is a is just a fantastical beliefs
because what you really don't want to admit and accept
is that reality is irreducibly mystical what does this mean
it means that actually it's impossible to know the nature
of existence using your finite mind you would think then
then will Leo then what's the point of me doing
metaphysics if I can't know well there's actually something prior
to knowing which is being so while you can't know
the nature of the absolute the ultimate nature again reality
you can become it because you are it because you're
not separate from it because separation is an idea part
of the materials paradigm which you're going to deconstruct at
which point you will realize that all your attempts to
explain reality as a chain of various linear causes and
effects which is what science attempts to do this never
actually gets you to the absolute it always leads you
around in a circle and it will never stop because
what you're doing is you're using a finite method to
explore an infinite reality so when you realize reality is
infinite and it's possible for you to realize that that's
the case then you will also realize that because it's
infinite you can't use various finite methods to encapsulate it
or to capture it or if you do the way
that sighs attempts you will always get partial solutions and
never the final total whole solution and so when you
realize that then you open yourself up to being reality
in its entirety accessing it directly through consciousness because consciousness
is all there really is because conscious all there is
you can access everything within reality directly using consciousness because
you are consciousness and you are the entire thing not
this limited thing that you thought you were that was
just a fantasy that you had which you believed was
a reality another way to define spirituality is that it's
escaping the matrix it's waking up it really feels like
that it feels like you're breaking what was once physical
reality you're breaking it down deconstructing it until you are
totally free of it and it's difficult to explain to
someone who's stuck inside the matrix what it means to
escape the matrix but if you've seen the movie you've
got a little bit of a taste for that or
if you woken up from a bad dream you got
a little bit of taste of what waking up is
so it's that but it's that taken to the nth
degree it's you waking up from this thing you call
life another way to define spirituality is that's online it's
aligning your life with the truth and with consciousness so
the truth is a tricky thing you can become conscious
to the truth but then most of your work will
be not in becoming conscious of the truth but bringing
the truth back down into your everyday life and embodying
the truth that's where the real spiritual work lies so
you might think that oh man I'm Lea I'm sitting
here every day meditating doing yoga doing all this hard
work for thousands of hours just to glimpse the truth
and then you do that you think okay finally I've
got it and it's like no you're only halfway up
the mountain the real work now is aligning your everyday
life changing all of your habits all your addictions all
of the nasty programming that you got from your culture
all of the false beliefs which are still there that
need to be deprogrammed and deconstructed that's the real work
spiritual purification needs to happen your ego needs to be
broken down your mind needs to surrender to the truth
in all the different ways you need to break down
all of your resistances to the truth and you've got
many many different internal resistances so seeing the truth wants
is not going to destroy all your internal resistances another
way to define spirituality is it's a dissolving of the
ego it's a dissolving of your separate sense of self
it's a conquering of your inner demons and your shadow
this entity that you believe that you are this biological
physical living organism that you think you are this is
an idea not the truth science is actually never proven
that you are a physical biological organism science has actually
never proven that you are your body never never has
it proven that because science cannot prove identity science can't
tell you what you are science can't prove to you
that you're not the table you're looking at I mean
it's the obvious stuff that people overlook right science has
ever proven the existence of a separate self nor will
it ever because the stuff itself is just an idea
just an illusion there's no objective truth to it it's
a it's a conceptual creation just like Santa Clause is
conceptual creation see Santa science can't prove to you that
Santa Claus is real because he's not real so it
doesn't even try to but it doesn't realize this science
can't prove to you that you're actually separate from your
coffee table nor has it ever nor will it ever
what people just naively sort of assume that it does
without thinking this stuff through if you are philosophically mining
you wanted a little puzzle to work on think about
this over the next week what kind of scientific experiment
could you construct that would prove to you that you
are not a coffee table think about it seriously I'm
not kidding think about it I dare you another way
to think about spirituality is that it's an expanding of
your circle of concern the less spiritual you are the
more ego you have the more you identify with being
this physical meatbag here the more you care about just
preserving this physical meatbag because that's what you think you
are so whatever you think you are you're going to
defend with your life because that is how you define
your life but when your sense of identity expands and
you realize that wait a minute there's no scientific reason
why my sense of identity has to be attached to
my body no reason at all it's like all the
sudden oh my sense of identity is expanding expanding expanding
expanding expanding until ultimately it becomes infinite it becomes everything
it becomes completely Universal and so as this expansion happens
as you work on dissolving your ego your circle of
concern increases such that you care more about people and
beings of all kinds animals and aliens and whatever you
want to care about it doesn't matter right you're the
larger your circle of concern the more the further out
into the universe your your compassion and love extends such
that when you're very egotistical all you care about is
you and your immediate family when you're a little bit
less egotistical you care about you your media family and
your friends and maybe even a stranger here there may
be a poor hungry person on the street when your
circle of concern expands beyond that then you care about
not just that not just your tribe not your just
your nation not just your country not just your religious
group but all human beings and all races on the
entire planet independent of whether they're good or bad people
you care about them all and then if it expands
even further than that then you care about also all
the living creatures not just the pretty ones not just
the the bears and the elephants but you care about
also the insects and the bugs and the spiders and
the bacteria and the viruses you care about everything and
then when it expands beyond that it expands beyond the
earth and you care about all sentient beings everywhere and
not just sentient beings but actually you realize that there
is no boundary between sentience within beings and outside of
beings and you realize that the entire universe is sentient
and so sentient conscious intelligent and so basically you have
indiscriminate care for all of existence another way to define
spirituality is that it's a profound sense of universal connectedness
you realize that you are connected physically connected to everything
in the in the known universe that has ever happened
or ever will happen is there difficult to explain and
to articulate just how profound that is and how how
significantly that changes your entire relationship to reality into human
beings and animals into creatures and so forth this is
huge what rationalists and atheists and materialists don't understand about
this sense of universal connectedness is that they think again
that it's an idea or a belief that's not what
it is though it's actually a physical fact so it's
not that you're gonna program yourself with an idea that
you're universally connected with everything no no what you're gonna
do is you're gonna remove the idea that you are
this separate thing that's separate from everything else when you
remove that idea what's left over infinite Universal connectedness as
a physical fact as a raw fact of your consciousness
another way to define spirituality is that it's altered states
of consciousness there are many different kinds of altered states
of consciousness so attaining these states exploring these days that's
what spirituality is about as distinct from beliefs and ideas
I mean actually new states of consciousness try to imagine
what that means it's hard because most people have only
been in one state of consciousness but again you know
it's not that hard because you have been in altered
states of consciousness you've been drunk you've been asleep you've
been dreaming you've been having a nightmare maybe you even
take a psychedelic and you got a little bit of
something going on there that's an altered states of consciousness
or maybe just you came out of a movie or
you were looking at the sunset and I gave you
an altered states of consciousness that's what we're talking about
but much much deeper and radically more different than ordinary
altered states of consciousness and the last way we can
define spirituality is that it's non symbolic science so you
might think well Leo this sounds very different from science
in fact it sounds contradictory and antithetical de science no
it's not what is science science is the pursuit of
understanding of reality that's what it is you have to
understand that science has had been evolving over the last
2,000 years really modern it's only about three four hundred
years old since Descartes since Galileo since Newton and even
since then it's evolved quite a bit every century it's
pretty much different we're always adding new methodologies to science
so right now the way that we define modern science
is that it's it's the investigation of reality using quantitative
measures and formulas quantifying reality so in that sense spirituality
is not science because you're not gonna be quantifying anything
but you have to realize that science is actually an
elastic notion so what was considered science 200 years ago
is not considered science anymore and vice-versa what wasn't considered
science now is because science realized its own mistakes that's
the nature of science so one of the mistakes that
science will realize in next hundred 200 years is that
there are non symbolic ways to do science conventional science
the way that it's been done it's been symbolic using
symbols like language models maps formulas equations these are all
symbols and that's good it works you can make sense
of little pieces of reality here and there by drawing
these maps using symbols that's fine but there is an
additional domain of science which is non symbolic science the
investigation of reality in a non symbolic fashion and that's
precisely what spirituality benefits our non symbolic which means you
have to do it without using symbols and without using
thoughts without using your mind so the problem though is
that most atheists materialists and scientifically minded people are so
thoroughly stuck in a paradigm that the only way to
realize or to understand reality is through the mind that
they are completely blind to ways of exploring reality not
through the mind what might that be well we'll get
there in a minute but there is such a thing
as non symbolic science non-symbolic consciousness in fact this is
a more direct version it's actually a more pure form
of science so while the conventional thinking is that science
is hard-nosed and fact-based and objective and spirituality is woowoo
and fluffy and emotions based it's actually the exact opposite
spirituality is a more purified form of science it's so
pure it's so direct that you don't even have room
to introduce symbols or models or Maps or equations because
those themselves introduce distortion and falsehood and delusion into your
understanding of reality it's a direct consciousness interface with reality
not mediated by any middleman symbols so those are the
various definitions of spirituality I have for you but what
you really have to understand is that you won't understand
spirituality unless you have a mystical experience for yourself in
the same way that you won't understand when an orgasm
is or what sex is unless you actually try it
for yourself and experience it so we can talk about
it all day long but you need to go experience
it what is spirituality not this is very important to
to mention spirituality is not religion dogma ideology or a
belief system of some kind religion is in fact an
aping of spirituality religion is what happens when you take
direct consciousness and you convert it into a belief system
and into an ideology and when you do that a
lot of bad stuff happens so if you hate religion
I'm with you I don't like religion either and and
religion really is the exact opposite of spirituality it mimics
spirituality but it gets people to believe rather than to
go and experience for themselves you know what religion is
religion would be like having sex without having sex it
would be like believing in orgasms and believing that sex
is great believing that sex exists without actually ever having
sex that's what religion is and you can see how
problematic that is because if what you do is you
program people that sex is amazing it's good and you
must believe in it you must pray to it every
single day but you never give them the tools or
even the understanding that hey you can actually go have
sex most religious people don't understand how they can actually
go do spirituality for real right so they get stuck
in their beliefs they're just thinking and imagining about orgasms
without actually having real orgasms and that's a very sad
thing it's a real disservice to two people spirituality is
not blind faith you're not being asked to blindly believe
anything here you're being asked to do practices to actually
experience the things that are being talked about in the
same way that if I was telling you about sex
I wouldn't be trying to get you to believe in
sex through blind faith the only reason we're talking about
sex is so that you could know about sex so
that then you can maybe go out there and find
a way to try it that's why we're talking about
it not so that you believe it and worship it
speaking of which spirituality is not worshipping of anything it's
not worshipping of gurus people deities images icons or anything
like that holy books preachers priests you don't even need
to worship God to do true spirituality in fact worshipping
is a big obstacle to spirituality spirituality is not obedience
to Authority or following rules spirituality is not religious customs
rituals or ceremonies like going to church spirituality is not
acting moral like obeying the Ten Commandments or being a
nice person being a nice person doesn't develop a spiritual
connection a superficial one it actually becomes an obstacle morality
becomes a huge obstacle to true spirituality spirituality is not
irrational illogical or on scientific thinking it's actually trans rational
trans logical trans scientific it's the next stage after rational
scientific thinking a spiritual person can still do rational logical
thinking can still do science perfectly in fact a spiritual
person's understanding of science and use of logic and reason
will actually be enhanced rather than diminished spirituality builds on
top of science and builds on top of rationality but
also goes beyond two realms beyond which the rational can't
access because it's too symbolic and too indirect by the
way you do realize that the only reason you believe
you exist is because you are directly conscious of your
existence you realize that so when you tell me for
example that olio I don't care about feelings or experiences
or emotions because all those are just hallucinations in the
brain chemical states and all that I just care about
the facts well you do realize that your facts your
so-called facts are also just a hallucination in the brain
a chemical state you realize that science is a chemical
State you realize that you realize that comic science is
happening within consciousness you realize this you realize that there
is no scientific evidence for your existence you realize this
unless you appeal to direct conscious experience you realize this
try to convince someone that you exist run this thought
experiment in your mind try to convince someone imagine that
someone never existed but somehow you could still let's say
communicate with them and you want to you want to
convince them that you really do exist and that there
actually is such a thing as existence how would you
do it come up with a scientific experiment to prove
to someone that existence is possible I dare you to
try that one and see where you get spirituality is
not wishful thinking and fear of death that's another very
common mistake that a theistic rational people make is they
think that well Leo but aren't you just coming up
with all these reasons and excuses and stories just to
justify your spiritual beliefs just because really what you want
is you are afraid of death you are afraid of
facing your own death and admitting that everything is meaningless
you're afraid of that and so therefore you're just coming
up with all sorts of stories and clever schemes to
deny the obvious which is that you're gonna die and
there's not gonna be anything special after you're dead hmm
it's exactly the opposite spirituality is the facing of your
own death actually it's the rationalists the Atheist the scientific
person who is avoiding his own death that's what all
your rationalist schemes are about you're avoiding your death but
not in the way you think not your physical death
what you're actually avoiding is your conceptual death because you
think you're a physical thing and the reason you believe
that is because that distracts and obvious kate's the truth
that actually what you are is your conceptual construction and
so what you fear most of all is the undermining
of your conceptual foundations because if I dropped and really
questioned if we sit down for five hours and I
question your existence long enough eventually you will realize that
you never existed in the first and that your existence
as a as a as a human body was just
a mental construction a belief wishful thinking and so the
reason you spent your whole life avoiding doing metaphysical inquiry
wasn't an accident it was very deliberate it was by
design because when you do metaphysical inquiry you're actually going
closer and closer towards the realization of your own death
death is a concept you are a concept so your
death will be conceptual but it will feel extremely real
to you because you believe you're real so until you
realize you're not real metaphysical questioning will feel life-threatening to
you which is why when you sit down and you
serious self inquiry serious deconstructions here is questioning your beliefs
serious meditation serious yoga you will have experiences and people
people post this on my forum they post it like
you know they get a little deeper into this a
few years of practice and then all the sudden they
say holy [ __ ] leo I was sitting there
meditating and then my heart started pounding and beating and
almost beating out of my chest I was terrified something
happened I feel like I was dying yeah you were
realizing that your fiction of course you were facing your
own death and now you understand why you were avoiding
doing spiritual work this whole time it was all just
a few stations all distractions for facing your own death
it's hello mind [ __ ] it's exactly the opposite
of what you've been led to believe spirituality is not
praying for material things asking for God to help you
with materialistic goals that's a that's a travesty of what
spirituality is it is not crusading against other people's beliefs
tried to convert them proselytize them make them believe in
the truth or anything like that spirituality is not about
creating or joining a cult cults or manipulative ego serving
and dogmatic and actually they keep you from true deep
spiritual insights spirituality is not politic it's not about trying
to transform the world into a better place to save
the whales and the polar bears and the environment and
all that and to get to rid the world of
racism and evil all those could be good things when
done properly in moderation and you don't swing your pendulum
too far and only react you know it's good probably
to save the polar bears and global warming and end
racism but this is all distractions from actually going inwards
and investigating the nature of existence first do that then
you can help improve the world once you know what
the world is because most people they try to fix
the world without knowing what it is and then they
make a even bigger mess spirituality is not preparing for
an afterlife there is no afterlife this is the afterlife
right here there's nowhere else to go there's no other
realm no other dimension right here you're just becoming conscious
of what's right here right now at all times you're
not flying to some mystical realm exploring some unknown territory
some astral celestial around none of that right here you're
just becoming conscious of what was here all the time
you're becoming conscious of what your hands are of what
your body is and what your mind is of what
your thoughts are what emotions are you're becoming conscious of
the most mundane things that's why it's difficult because people
love outlandish ideas like flying into outer space and seeing
aliens and astral realms and this and that and angels
and spooky stuff and spirits this is all distraction from
becoming conscious of what's right here existence is right here
existence is happening at all times you just need to
train your mind on it train your awareness on it
and it will reveal itself to you over time do
with it spirituality is not proving things proving things is
a trap and it's a mistake it's actually impossible to
prove existence to anybody and it's impossible to actually prove
the absolute to anybody because all proof is indirect the
truth the absolute truth actually cannot be proven truth is
a much vaster domain than proof this is something people
don't even scientific people don't understand this if you want
to really understand this you need to study Google's incompleteness
theorem I have a I have an episode about that
the metaphysical implications of Google's and completeness theorem study that
because what Google proved is that actually truth is larger
than proof and that you can never prove the entire
truth that's a pretty significant mind-warping discovery and what's even
more amazing that he was actually able to prove it
using logical symbols pretty pretty amazing stuff I'll talk more
about that in the future why that why truth cannot
be proven by definition it's impossible to prove truth because
proof is always using indirect methods whereas truth also includes
proof inside of it proof is a part of truth
but it's a smaller part of truth it's a sub-domain
proof as a subdomain of truth so that's important to
understand spirituality is also not about constructing elaborate theories that's
actually science and philosophy poor academic philosophies what does that
not real philosophy spirituality is is not a subjective romantic
experience and spirituality is not a chemical brain state now
this one is the one that materialists and rationalist and
atheists struggle the most to understand because let's say well
leo all this stuff you're talking about it sounds nice
but in the end astrologist mystical experiences just chemicals in
the brain just a brain state no you don't understand
when you're when you're probing of existence reaches such a
deep level that you start to question what a chemical
is and what a brain is and what a state
is and what experience is what science is you will
eventually come to a point where you will realize that
all of those things including including chemical brain states and
the idea that reality is happening inside your brain that
thoughts and experiences are happening inside of the brain you
will realize that that is a conceptual construction and when
that happens oh boy oh boy that's a that's a
profound that's a profound epiphany it's one thing to hear
me say it it's one thing for you to understand
what I'm saying conceptually it's a whole nother ballgame for
you to actually grasp that none of this that's going
on right here is happening inside of a brain you
can become directly conscious of it you can become roughly
conscious that a brain is actually a conceptual construction a
thought that you're thinking that's something that's something that's deep
that's deep and that thought is not happening inside of
a brain hello it's a complete turning inside out of
what you think reality is it's it's freaky when you
get to this point it's freaky you actually start to
think you're losing your mind because really what losing your
mind means is that you're actually losing your grip and
grounding on reality you can no longer distinguish between what's
real and unreal anymore and you might think leo well
but that that sounds like that's bad that sounds like
it's not objective truth anymore no but that is the
truth the truths that there is no difference between truth
and fantasy reality and thought that's what it means to
say that you're inside of a giant mind what you
think is what gets created in a sense there are
different kinds of spirituality let me list some of these
for you there's nature mysticism shamanism various tribal forms of
spirituality like voodoo these are commonly found in undeveloped primitive
tribes in Africa South America Aboriginal Australia other places like
that and it is a sort of authentic form of
spirituality they do have deep mystical insights but also there's
problems with it it's not very sophisticated pretty crude of
course there's one who talks religion Christianity Islam Buddhism Hinduism
so forth the Orthodox versions of it these are ideological
and belief based and these people they can experience spiritual
insights genuine spiritual insights using these Orthodox methods but it's
it's really corrupt it's really problematic it's more of a
problem and a hindrance than it is a vehicle towards
true spirituality so I don't recommend it at all very
very problematic it's very egocentric it's very ethnocentric it tends
to be very much focused on good and evil and
moralization a lot of distractions politics political issues it's a
big hornets nest there's also meditative States and yoga this
is really good this is this is some really high-quality
spiritual practice stuff there's also visualizations areas visualization techniques you
can use to develop a metaphysical connection with reality there's
also psychedelics there's non duality and enlightenment which is like
the purest form of spirituality that's what I highly recommend
you pursue and then there's other versions of spirituality here
which I could talk about but I won't because if
I did it would be beyond your ability to believe
and it would actually be a hindrance to you understanding
what I'm trying to communicate in this episode because if
you're listening to this episode the way that I intend
and I really intend this to be sort of as
an introduction for rationalists and atheists and scientists you're not
at a place in your development and your consciousness where
you can understand what I would want to tell you
about some of these other kinds of spirituality they would
seem so outlandish to you that you would never believe
that they're real and it would hurt my credibility to
mention them so we'll just skip those for now a
little teaser for you let's talk about how spirituality evolves
with society if you've seen my episodes about spiral dynamics
then let me fill you in on that basically spirituality
happens at every color stage in the spiral purple red
blue orange green yellow turquoise if you don't know what
these are go check out my mini-series like six episodes
about spiral dynamics it's a pretty complex and nuanced model
so don't worry if you don't know the colors let
me just run through them really quickly so spirituality the
way it works at purple is that it's tribal and
very shamanistic and magical and kinda like voodoo at stage
red which is their egocentric I don't even know what
spirituality looks like a sage red I guess you could
say like militant Islam might be stage red spirituality but
mostly a stage red you don't you don't get much
spirituality then at stage blue the next stage you've got
Orthodox religion which is very conformist egocentric ethnocentric ritualistic literal
interpretations of Bibles and holy texts it emphasizes worship of
icons and it's a very materialistic form of spirituality and
it's all about good and evil us versus them it's
very tribal mmm nationalistic then we've got the orange stage
which comes after that which is secular and scientific and
rationalist and at this stage not much spirituality going on
it's a rejection of religion there's a conflation of spirituality
with religion so both of them are basically denied and
not pursued seriously maybe an orange scientific person might get
little tastes of that spiritual metaphysical wonder but they will
explain it to themselves it's just a feeling a nice
feeling and they won't make much of it they won't
take it seriously so they won't pursue that path then
the next stage up is you evolve into green and
at green this is the hippie stage the New Age
a lot of New Age teachings here neo shamanism comes
back you've got people saying that their spiritual but but
they're not religious they're making a distinction between spirituality and
religion they are smoking weed and doing other kinds of
psychedelics perhaps and that's opening their up their mind but
not very deeply these people are all about peace and
love and saving the environment saving the whales this sort
of stuff they have an intuition that there's something higher
some spiritual aspect to reality but they don't really do
any serious practices so their spirituality is is usually pretty
surface level but at least usually it's not some very
violent or oppressive the way that it was it blew
they don't try to push their spirituality on on the
rest of society the way that blue did then they're
staged yellow where you have some visionary scientists again maybe
people like the fathers of quantum mechanics Niels Bohr Schrodinger
Einstein Max Born who else am I forgetting yeah Arthur
Eddington folks like that there are they're really kind of
cutting edge scientists who are actually meta physicians they're not
just scientists hacks they're not just academics they're actually serious
metaphysicians they actually think about the nature of existence pretty
deeply which is what allows them to be great scientists
and they're starting to become idealist and they're starting to
tune in to the fact that consciousness is fundamental and
cannot be explained using physical phenomena and all of these
people that I mentioned all these fathers of quantum mechanics
they were all idealists and mystics and they all basically
believed that reality was a mind a physical system Niels
Bohr Arthur Eddington to some degree Einstein Schrodinger for sure
they start to study Eastern philosophy they start to study
advisor they start to study Hinduism you start to see
their mind opening up to this but still they haven't
really penetrated to the deep spiritual realms yet the deep
spiritual insights precisely because they're held back by their rationalism
and they're still trying to symbolize everything still trying to
put it into formulas and numbers and then there's the
final level which is turquoise and turquoise is where you
get full-blown non-duality sages Yogi's folks like the Buddha maybe
like Jesus I don't know if they were really trick
wise but you know it's it's nice to think they
were this is where you start to really tap into
and develop this really deep metaphysical connection to reality you
can be totally conscious of the absolute nature of everything
and also you're tolerant of all the other spiritual traditions
usually if you're doing this properly and your understanding is
global and very holistic so spirituality is different depending on
what level of development you're at and your culture is
at so you got to be very careful the reason
I'm telling you all this all this detail is because
you got to be very careful not to think of
spirituality as just as one bucket it's like this one
monolithic thing and you eat you're either for it or
against it it's like it's either religion or not this
very black and white very crude conception that many atheists
have some atheists are more sophisticated and they actually leave
room open for spirituality other atheists like Richard Dawkins are
more militants and more dogmatic and they are completely close-minded
to spirituality and they see spirituality is somehow a threat
to science or somehow fundamentally incompatible or splurt splurt spreading
misinformation or delusion which itself that position is a delusion
house fear - Audi practice there are far more methods
than most people would imagine or lead you to believe
most teachers will never teach you or tell you about
the full list of methods because there's a lot of
them few people have mastered all of them and usually
people are so myopic and siloed that they only experience
a small fraction of these methods rejecting the rest but
these are all valid legitimate methods meditation concentration self inquiry
contemplation various forms of yoga both physical hatha yoga but
more importantly the meditative yoga that's popular in the East
and within Hinduism Tantra and so forth various breath techniques
like pranayama and holotropic breathwork pioneered by stan grof psychedelics
a very powerful method I highly recommend it chanting mantras
astral projection visualization darkroom retreats auditory driving which is what's
primarily used for inducing mystical trances within shamanism not psychedelics
but actually auditory driving is mostly used vision quests which
is where you endure a horrible ordeal out in the
desert for example with no food and no water for
days for weeks and you suffer through that until you
start to get mystical insides sweat lodges hard on the
version of that fasting another version of that lucid dreaming
Solo retreats like I've documented in various videos especially on
my blog that I do on a yearly basis but
Pastner retreats the Posten of meditation reading various spiritual texts
this is important and believe it or not you can
have mystical experiences while reading a high-quality spiritual text especially
some of the non-dual texts that I have in my
book list you should check those out yeah you could
be reading one of those then it just hits you
like a lightning bolt BAM it hits you all the
sudden that science is just a belief system or hits
you all the sudden that your physical body is just
a conceptual constructions like holy [ __ ] and you
get that while you're reading this book so that's a
legitimate legitimate way so don't let people to think that
reading books is all about mental masturbation no it's not
not if you're doing it properly in fact it's it's
very important if you don't read spiritual books and you
try to do spirituality you are almost guaranteed to [
__ ] it up books are necessary to to reveal
to you the traps that you will fall into and
there are many many traps they will also reveal to
you techniques that you couldn't learn any other way Tantra
is in the practice shadow work is important part of
spiritual work journaling can be really good practice workshops there
are various workshops you could find around the world around
the country that teach this stuff and help you practice
this stuff I'll Prentiss Shipp programs you can actually go
apprentice with a yogi with a sage with the master
in various different traditions from zen to adviser non traditional
non-orthodox apprenticeships and suffering suffering is a method for spiritual
work in fact it's a very powerful method but I
won't go into it here so these are the various
methods there's definitely more than this but this gets you
a good understanding of the the basics of it let's
take an intermission right here so I can take a
break catch my breath and I'll be back with some
more insights for you you know when I was in
my teens I used to do a lot of philosophical
inquiry I was just one of those kids that was
really curious about the nature of reality and I just
asked myself questions about you know how does it all
work and what does it mean and why does it
work this way and not that way and so forth
and sometimes I remember late at night in my room
I would just kind of sit there after I did
all my homework and all my schoolwork and all that
stuff maybe played some video games then late at night
I would just kind of sit there by myself in
the dark and just ponder about some of these existential
philosophical questions and that was right around the phase where
I got interested in philosophy and I really enjoyed that
it was just something I didn't know why I was
doing it no one told me to do it my
family wasn't into it I really wasn't taught to do
it at school it was just something I just became
genuinely curious about and I just sort of did as
a hobby and I thought about life and I thought
about religion and I thought about the possibility of God
and I thought about evolution and I thought about all
this sort of stuff and as I was contemplating this
at night I would get this feeling this kind of
satisfying feeling of not having the answers but just thinking
about the the questions just thinking about them gave me
a satisfying feeling and it sort of grounded me even
though I had no particular answers I was very non
ideological I just really was interested in what are the
answers to these questions and I didn't really have a
preference for which way the answers came out I was
just doing pure inquiry for inquiries sake at that time
I didn't understand that what I was doing was extremely
rare yet this is something that almost no human beings
ever do almost never and that was because the way
I was raised I was I was raised in a
in a sort of non ideological family where I wasn't
I wasn't told to believe certain things or to partake
in certain rituals I was just basically kind of like
left to my own devices and for that I'm really
grateful to my parents for that because that allowed me
to stay open-minded and to keep my mind open to
just doing questioning but the reason I mentioned that is
because in those moments is when I developed that metaphysical
connection to reality but very importantly I didn't connect the
dots and I didn't understand that what that was was
me doing spirituality I didn't understand that I thought spirituality
was religion and that was something I didn't like at
all in fact a lot of the time that I
spent in the dark just enquiring being skeptical I really
considered myself a skeptic that was sort of my identity
throughout high school is I was the arch skeptic everything
was skeptical to me I would question everything and of
course religion I had some religious friends in high school
and I just couldn't fathom what the [ __ ]
they were believing and what their arguments were like it
just made no sense to me it seemed completely irrational
and ridiculous and of course it was irrational and ridiculous
because that was religious dogma but see what I thought
I was doing was just being a skeptic and juice
doing philosophy what I didn't realize what it took me
years decades to realize that actually what I was doing
was true spirituality so the reason I want to bring
that example forth here is because I get the feeling
that some of you might be like that you might
identify as skeptics and at that point I identified myself
as an atheist that's because I didn't really understand I
didn't connect the dots deeply enough so if you're one
of these people who is philosophical who is skeptical who
is interested in thinking about reality in a serious way
not taking anyone's word for it not wanting to believe
anything not trusting books not religious books not scientific books
you want to really get to the bottom of it
for yourself you genuinely care about the truth well understand
my friend that you are following the truest most purest
spiritual path that's what that is don't let all this
religious nonsense confuse you because it's very easy to get
confused speaking of confusion why is spirituality such a murky
and Confused topic you might think Leo if what you're
saying is correct and you're laying it out here so
starkly and so simply and so directly then why is
there so much disagreement all around the world from all
the various different spiritual traditions if you're saying Leo that
there's some absolute truth that can be directly experienced by
everyone through some kind of direct consciousness then what's the
big deal why is it so tricky why is it
so misunderstood why are all be there all these religions
why it's so corrupt why does all this all these
problems happen why doesn't science just go investigate it figure
it out write it down in a textbook and then
just everyone will know about it without an answer to
this question you're very easily likely to get tripped up
the reason that this question comes up is because people
do not appreciate just how significant truth is with a
capital T you begin the inquiry by thinking that well
yeah maybe I can access the truth somehow it sure
would be nice if I could access the truth and
figure out what the [ __ ] this reality thing
is maybe I can't maybe I can let me take
a stab at it and but then you go deeper
and deeper down the rabbit hole and then eventually if
you ever to get the chance to glance upon the
absolute truth the truth of the capital T using direct
consciousness and not symbols what you discover is that this
thing is so [ __ ] gargantuan it's so radical
it's so staggering that then you finally understand why you
couldn't simply understand it the way you thought you could
initially when you began your inquiry then you understand why
your inquiry had to go so deep and take so
many twists and turns and why all the other people
around you got so confused and engaged in all these
debates and disagreements and fights and arguments and there was
all this corruption and misunderstanding about this topic because the
truth of the capital T is I mean think about
this when we're talking about the truth of the capital
T the absolute we're actually talking about getting down to
the to the origin of existence we're talking about answering
the question of the or of existence now either you
believe that's not possible or you believe it's possible if
you believe it's not possible then you're a lost cause
that's it you're done you've already failed there's no chance
for you if you believe it is possible then there's
a chance now you can actually do some work but
even if you believe it is possible you still don't
comprehend the size and magnitude of what you're really talking
about this is a massive gargantuan thing this truth if
you understood that from the get-go you would understand that
the truth cannot be symbolized or understood or captured encapsulated
with any kind of images models maps equations even thoughts
or language of any kind to think that the truth
can be symbolized can be proven can be communicated can
be spoken can be written down in a text book
and then read the way that you might read a
magazine at your dentist's office while you're waiting for your
appointment that's how a lot of people think about the
truth with a capital T is they think oh well
leo if there is this true the capital T what
do you be beating around the bush for just tell
me what it is man tell me what it is
all accepted I'm a big man I can take it
as if you're just like flipping through a magazine it's
like oh there's an article on the truth let me
just read that one and then you read it and
like okay I'm done I understand I I just read
about the the origin of all of existence yeah I
got it I'm good now let's go let me go
see my dentist now let me carry on with with
life as I always have as if it would work
that way no no you don't understand yet you don't
understand that your entire life is hinged to this question
of the truth of capital T we're talking about your
very existence here and how you came into being this
is a massive massive I know accounts first-person accounts with
teachers that I've studied with face-to-face who told me that
when they first glanced upon the absolute and it just
struck them out of the blue a lot of times
it's trucks you out of the blue you you might
be sitting there meditating for it for days but then
it just strikes you when you least expect it maybe
you're going for a walk through the woods and bam
it strikes you it strikes you so [ __ ]
hard and knocks you to the ground on your ass
from your walk in the woods that's the magnitude of
this insight that we're talking about I've had other teachers
who have studied with and had conversations with who told
me that when they realized the truth for themselves that
they secluded themselves took themselves out of society stopped work
for years maybe stopped working for five years stopped talking
with family and friends for five years just to sit
and to bask in the magnitude of this insight that's
how big the truth is when you really get it
it's utterly life transforming its massive it completely changes everything
you thought about reality it flips it inside-out it's radical
to most people that would be horrifying terrifying life threatening
this [ __ ] will derail your entire life it
recontextualizes everything life as you know it is over after
you've discovered the absolute and you've really understood it you've
really got it you can get sometimes little glimpses of
it here and there but then it escapes you you
fall back to sleep but when you really get it
you get it very deeply this is no little insight
this is nothing you just hear in a video and
then you just move on with your life as though
nothing changed so it's precisely because the truth is so
gargantuan it's literally infinite but see you have no appreciation
for what the word infinite actually means you have some
concept of the infinite that you got from mathematics that's
not actual infinity you don't know what actual infinity really
means you can't possibly know unless you become directly conscious
of it so because of this you completely underestimate what
this thing is you completely underestimate what existence is how
counterintuitive it is how unlimited it is how big it
is so the ego underestimates this and and so the
ego just treats this as just some sort of simple
little pursuit and the ego doesn't understand how tricky it
is how tricky the ego mind is how self deceptive
it is all the layers of self-deception that are at
work to prevent you from seeing this truth it's no
accident that you don't see the truth it's no accident
that your friends your family members your college professors your
teachers in elementary school your boss your co-workers that none
of them have ever glimpsed the absolute it's no accident
it's by the design of the way the mind is
structured because as it turns out your very existence hinges
upon you not seeing the truth the absolute because your
existence as a human being is finite whereas the truth
is infinite this creates a rather problematic existential problem how
do you view using direct consciousness something that's infinite while
you still want to remain and maintain your finiteness people
don't get this this is I'm explaining to you why
people misunderstand the truth so much and why there's so
much confusion there's so much confusion because the truth is
easily corrupted there's so much confusion because the truth cannot
be symbolized and cannot be communicated at all because it's
everything how do you communicate the entire universe to somebody
with a formula with an image with a model think
again doesn't work that way you might think that once
you discover the absolute then you can just write a
textbook about it and then share the textbook with all
of humanity and they would all just understand and how
wrong you would be if you did that what you
would do is actually you would delude everybody with a
model of the truth your communication of the truth which
is limited finite symbolic and therefore not the infinite truth
which is of course precisely what religion has tried to
do for 2,000 years and has failed miserably so if
you think you can write a scientific textbook about the
absolute guess again you're just gonna start a new religion
that's all it's gonna happen you're just going to delude
people and yourself in the process there's also so much
confusion because consciousness is a complex terrain even people who
do spiritual work and NiO advise and so forth maybe
they have a few glimpses of the truth they still
oversimplify completely oversimplify this domain of consciousness studies which is
what spirituality is and they think of it as just
a simple okay I'm just gonna get the truth I'm
gonna get enlightened BAM I'm done okay move on with
my life everything's peachy that's not how it works there's
so many facets and so many M nuances and complexities
to the truth to consciousness so many different fields of
altered states of consciousness and different ways to access them
so it's a complicated terrain and this is why spiritual
traditions have so much diversity and complexity to them so
many different teachings and techniques different subtleties nuances and so
forth it really is a complex terrain think of it
like mathematics if you wanted to understand mathematics you couldn't
do it by watching one video or hearing some one
piece of advice or some one truth about mathematics no
mathematics is a complicated domain which includes a lot of
subdomains and subfields that can be their own fee of
study you can spend the rest of your life you
can spend 50 years of your life just studying topology
or differential equations or statistics or you know set theory
category Theory geometry trigonometry analytic geometry algebra various versions of
algebra various kinds of bulan logics and so forth right
there's there's so much to mathematics you'd be hard-pressed to
find one professor who understood all of mathematics and could
teach it to you even if they understood it how
many hours how many days how many years do you
have to learn it you have ten years to learn
every field of mathematics that would be very optimistic to
say you could do it in ten years even if
you could find a professor who understood it all it's
very complicated terrain this creates a lot of confusion because
people don't like to think that there's a complex terrain
they want to make it very simple like oh just
Leo sit sit and do nothing there's nothing to do
you're already it bla bla bla you're already enlightened bla
bla bla bla bla why this kind of neo-advaita nonsense
thinking that tries to oversimplify spirituality that creates its own
set of traps and problems another reason why there's so
much confusion misunderstanding is that human beings have different hardware
we have different genetics we have different physiology different chemicals
and neurotransmitters in our brains in different levels we have
different childhood experiences growing up we grew up in different
cultures so we're dealing with with different substrates so to
speak that we need to spiritualize which means that different
people will spiritual eyes that same substrate in different ways
spirituality is deeply personal you're the one who has to
realize it you're the one who has to dissolve your
own ego and work through your inner demons these are
deeply personal things all your obstacles are deeply personal and
no two people have the exact same obstacles and in
fact no two people I would submit have access to
the exact same spiritual insights and there there are very
many possibilities of of different ways that consciousness can be
different degrees of consciousness different just different I mean people
underestimate this but we do have different hardware so to
speak just to work with despite the fact that I
said that that Bray's are conceptual and hardware of course
is still conceptual but we're just using this to try
to explain that you know every individual needs to work
through their own obstacles and issues for some people they're
just born naturally more conscious more naturally more spiritual some
people are born with a with a natural inclination to
be really good at self-discipline which tends to be a
really important quality force be able to practice some people
are born and just are naturally born philosophers and are
interested in questions of the metaphysical nature like I think
I was and in that sense I was very lucky
whereas most people aren't born that way a lot of
people are born into terrible families toxic families who who
brainwashed them from an early age with all sorts of
religious and scientific nonsense which then is so hardwired into
the human psyche so early on that by the time
they're teenagers well good luck on wiring all that might
take you a few decades to do that if you're
lucky then you succeed at all so because of this
different spiritual teachers and traditions have different teachings this creates
confusion adds complexity to the to the whole game it's
not just as simple as like let me take every
human in the world and just tell them a couple
of things and they're gonna become enlightened doesn't work that
way it's much more complicated than that the teacher needs
to be highly custom tailored to the student so that
they can make sense of it especially because their mind
is so tricky that their mind will find all sorts
of excuses rationalizations and denials for avoiding doing the work
another reason why there's so much misunderstanding and confusion is
because don't forget our culture even though we are in
the 21st century don't think that we're at the end
of our evolution societally speaking we're still in the dark
ages still in the dark ages yes we've sent a
man to the moon and we can make jumbo jets
and iPhones and we've got the internet and all these
gadgets and stuff and we think that we're so sophisticated
but really the level of cultural evolution is even more
primitive than our technological level of evolution our cultures and
societies are very very primitive science is still very primitive
the scientist method itself is still primitive he still doesn't
recognize for example non symbolic direct consciousness doesn't recognize it
in the same way that 300 years ago science didn't
recognize microscopes and telescopes as legitimate instruments for exploring and
investigating reality just didn't recognize them so in the centuries
to come our culture and our science will evolve and
change in such a way that it will be easy
for future generations in let's say 500 years it will
be easy for them to understand what I'm talking about
but only because I've talked about it and I've popularized
these ideas and I was at the cutting edge helping
to to promote these ideas along with many other people
who are doing the same thing that I am and
it's because of us because what we're walking around and
kind of like blaring the trumpets about this thing called
spirituality and Awakening and we're trying to show people how
to do it properly so they don't delude themselves further
like many people in the past have thanks to those
people and maybe you'll be one of those if you
get it one day then thanks to those people there
will be evolution science will evolve spirituality will evolve religion
will evolve culture will of all we will move up
the spiral dynamic stages and all that good stuff and
and then it will be easy the mistake people make
is they just assume that well more than twenty first
century we figured everything out pretty much sure there's some
stuff science doesn't understand maybe dark matter dark energy but
that's not very important mostly we've got a reality figured
out we've got the scientific method figured out scientists know
everything universities know everything it's all been written down in
the textbooks nothing there's nothing really important to discover there's
nothing that's gonna recontextualize my entire reality though so it's
like no you're taking it completely for granted what you're
doing is you're expecting culture to deliver truth to you
on a silver platter but that's just not how truth
works to expect that you can't just sit back play
the skeptic be [ __ ] lazy and sit there
and like a cynic criticizing everything not doing anything acting
like a smart aleck rationalist and thinking that people need
to come to you to prove the truth to you
with that attitude you're never gonna discover the truth not
even in 500 years when everybody around you discovers it
because it's a deeply personal thing direct consciousness that means
you're involved no one can do it for you you
can't read it in a textbook so this immediately excludes
99% of people because 90% of people just are accepting
knowledge that human society has discovered they don't actually do
any independent investigation of anything because they're lazy and they
believe that there's no purpose to do it leo if
I can just go watch a video why would I
even need to read a book people are so lazy
these days that they come up with excuses for me
to me about why they shouldn't read books that's the
level of [ __ ] laziness and complacency that we're
seeing right now in 21st century society and you're wondering
how come you haven't seen the absolute you're too lazy
to read [ __ ] 10 books coming up with
[ __ ] excuses not to mention the thousands of
hours of yoga or meditation that you might need to
do to have a glimpse of the absolute you expect
a video to deliver this to you get the [
__ ] out of here no video is gonna deliver
this to you no teachers gonna do it for you
no gurus gonna do it for you no one's gonna
do it for you unless you do it so now
you see that this excludes 99.99999% of people from ever
accessing the truth immediately excluded because they're too [ __
] lazy and they don't have enough vision to see
why an independent inquiry is worth your time and effort
there's also a lot of confusion misunderstanding because it does
take hardcore personal practice to realize and to actualize spirituality
hard self disciplined boring excruciatingly mind-numbing lonely you're all alone
just sitting there for hours and hours and hours doing
this practice again this all immediately excludes 99.99999% of people
from ever accessing the truth they'll never do that immediately
excluded they can't justify to themselves see they have so
little vision they can't justify themselves sitting down to do
these practices can't do it can't motivate themselves can't do
it consistently cannot spend five years of doing one hour
a day of meditation without missing a single day can't
do it that excludes millions and billions of people right
there just can't do that another reason there's so much
confusion is because very paradoxically and unbelievably it's because the
truth is simply too good to believe too good it's
too good it's way too good the truth is so
good good with a capital G so good that if
I told you how good it was you would Sam
[ __ ] you would say I'm exaggerating you would
say I'm lying you would say I'm being a woowoo
mm-hmm you'd say I'm being airy-fairy but it would still
be a million times better than anything I could say
that's how good it is so when you discover it
one of the one of the first things that will
cross your mind if you're like me is that you're
gonna you're gonna feel unworthy you're gonna glimpse this truth
you're gonna see how good it is and then you're
gonna say oh my god this is impossible this cannot
be possible I'm not worthy of anything this good and
so actually a lot of what spiritual work entails is
opening your self up having enough self-esteem building yourself esteem
and self worth to the point where you're actually able
to accept something so good how do you accept something
infinitely good you might say alia that's not a problem
I'll take the good stuff give me more good stuff
I can take it no you can't you don't understand
your ego is actually only used to a certain level
of goodness that you can take in your life anything
beyond that and actually what your ego will do it
will sabotage you to actually drop out of that state
of pleasure and ecstasy and goodness and joy and it'll
drop you back down into your negativity into your pessimism
into your all all that petty nasty negative stuff that
your ego does so you got to raise yourself to
be able to carry that a good metaphor that I've
I've heard other teachers use is the lightbulb analogy so
you know when you first start with spirituality and you
start to help meditation so it's like Adelle X and
so forth it's sort of like you're coming to a
power plant with a little light bulb and you want
to plug that light bulb directly into the power plant
what happens you do that and immediately bursts because it's
way too much power can't can't carry it so the
next time you go oh [ __ ] that was
a lot of power that was amazing but it lasted
- too short so the next time you back with
a bigger light bulb you stick that in there and
then it lasts for a minute and then it explodes
again you still can't carry the infinite energy that's being
transmitted through it so the next time I may be
a year later you come back with a bigger light
bulb after doing a lot of inter work on yourself
you've expanded yourself so now that is you becoming the
bigger light bulb you screw yourself into the infinite source
again and it fries your brain in five minutes and
then you're like [ __ ] I got to go
back to the drawing board and work on myself again
so that next time maybe I can last 10 minutes
and you keep doing this over and over and over
again until one day maybe you get to the point
where you're able to screw yourself in and then you
never get unscrewed that energy will be coursing through you
forever now you have become and merged into that energy
that's what it's sort of like and that's what a
lot of the work entails is opening yourself up to
that infinite goodness that infinite beauty that infinite power that
infinite intelligence the infinite creativity that's there the the infinite
wisdom and insights the infinite compassion the Avi omnipresence the
Omni the omniscience of it it's all there it's way
too much for you to handle it's way too much
for any mere mortal to handle unless they've done a
lot of inner work and lastly the reason that it's
so confusing and misunderstood and everybody misses the truth is
because it is extremely threatening to your very life because
after all your life is a conceptual fabrication so just
try to imagine that if you were a conceptual fabrication
what might be your greatest enemy what might be the
thing you fear the most what does a snail fear
a snail fears salt what does a fire fear fears
water what does a shadow fear it fears light and
what does a false ego fear it fears truth why
is it because it spells the demise the light spells
the demise of the shadow so what does the shadow
have to do the shadow has to warp itself to
convince itself that actually the light is the enemy that
the light is the evil so the shadow will actually
call the light shadow and call shadow dark or shadow
light you see it has to it has to call
falsehood truth and truth falsehood so most people simply resist
the truth because they think it's falsehood and they stick
with the falsehood because they've called it the truth this
is the first trick that the devilish mind plays very
tricky why is spirituality important and Leo how is it
useful you're saying after all there is a sort of
science and science is useful so how spirituality useful is
it falsifiable does it have any practical implications in my
life why should I pursue this stuff beyond merely the
feelings that you're talking about again remember the feelings are
just a symptom of you actually being connected with the
truth so you're not really pursuing feelings in the pursuit
of spirituality but you're pursuing is the absolute truth and
then the feelings you get that's sort of the kicker
the little side dish little garnish a little low you
know cherry on top of your ice cream it's this
sort of the reward for for being loyal to the
truth but anyways there are some practical consequences first of
all I want you to understand and this is a
very big point that all human dysfunction comes from disconnection
from the truth fundamentally that's what it is whatever problems
you think you have whatever problems you think mankind and
society and government has they're all connected to the fact
that mankind in society is disconnected from the truth falsehood
creates sickness and disease figuratively and literally most of the
diseases that we have the physical hard disease I'm talking
about cancer heart attack obesity depression schizophrenia various kinds of
autism and mental disorders anxiety panic attacks fear anger craving
jealousy pettiness theft criminality rape violence torture war genocide racism
slavery corruption in the government gang violence white-collar crime what
do you think all this comes from oh sure there's
a million different causes but all of those go down
to one root cause which is disconnection from truth a
person who is connected to truth is not going to
become a criminal it's not gonna become a thief or
rapist or depressed or angry or even be fat and
obese you know why you're fat and obese fundamentally the
root problem yeah you could say you're eating too many
calories and this and that I mean that's all true
but fundamentally why because you're just gonna get from the
truth you're using food as a substitute for truth to
get the pleasure the pleasure that truth should be giving
you you don't get so instead what you do is
you go for food or you go for drugs or
you go for TV or porn to some other addiction
or you go for some white-collar crime to pay for
your fancy lifestyle for your house and for your trophy
wife and for this and that and cars and women
and so forth see why do you think it cancer
cancer is one of those diseases that's very preventable a
lot of it has to do because you're disconnected with
truth the way you live your life the way you
use your mind and you would say Oh leo but
cancer is about the toxins that are in the environment
and this and that that's right and how do you
think those toxins got into the environment who do you
think polluted the environment and for what reason because they
were disconnected from truth now I'm not saying that with
spirituality you have a hundred percent chance to cure all
your cancer and all this but uh but I mean
certainly there are many many examples of people who have
cured terrible crippling life-threatening diseases both physical ones and mental
ones and emotional ones through deep spiritual work so even
though there's no guarantee that your cancer will be cured
some forms of cancer you know if you have terrible
toxins and heavy metals in your body then that might
not be something you can cure with spiritual practice but
then again you know some cancers just come from stress
over stress like you're going to work and you're dealing
with all the crap at work for twenty years that
could definitely cause cancer or the fact that you're going
to work and then you're eating terrible food and and
maybe you're living in an environment that you shouldn't be
living in because you're not very conscious and you're too
lazy to move out to change your environment and that
gives you cancer and certainly things like fear anxiety anger
craving depression all of these mental and psychosomatic issues chronic
fatigue insomnia fibromyalgia various autoimmune disorders a lot of these
aren't directly from your disconnection from truth because you see
when you're disconnected from truth it's not merely that you're
just going from truth and you just sit around all
day and just enjoy your life no no when you're
disconnected from truth you're empty inside so you're running around
and chasing for some kind of substitute and whatever substitute
you're finding it usually a very toxic and poor substitute
whether it's video games porn heroin opioids whatever we've got
a terrible opioid epidemic right now over 50,000 people every
single year dying why is this happening you might say
well leo it's the fault of the pharmaceutical companies by
the way a lot of these over death overdoses don't
come from heroin but from prescription pills that doctors are
writing that's right I mean there is a lot of
corruption within the pharmaceutical industry for sure and do we
do need to create crackdown on that with Ray at
various forms of regulation but the real root is that
these people who are taking these drugs are just created
from truth if you were connect to the truth you
wouldn't need opioids you wouldn't need pills if you were
conscious enough you would be able to transcend your pain
and all your suffering even terrible physical ailments so that's
extremely practical what we're talking about here is we're talking
about happiness peace of mind and the elimination of suffering
that's extremely practical and that's one reason why people take
upon spirituality take on spirituality rather is not because they're
metaphysically curious but simply because they're one of these rats
who have been running around in this maze like I've
said before and they come to a dead end in
life which is so terrible so miserable so much suffering
that they look for any escape any solution to the
suffering otherwise they will kill themselves by the way we
have record numbers of suicides every year as well in
the tens of thousands of course that's because of disconnection
from truth it's all these mass shootings we have in
schools disconnection from truth and so mmm so this rats
get gets stuck in this dead-end and is suffering so
much that's simply out of desperation pure desperation as a
last resort it turns to spirituality and maybe if it's
lucky it finds a good spiritual practice and then it's
able to break through but many rats aren't aren't able
to do that simply because they don't they don't really
know how to do a serious legit spiritual practice so
what they do is they just end up in a
dead end and they either suffer miserably for the rest
of their life in some sort of dead-end job dead-end
relationship abuse of relationship terrible career whatever they get saddled
with all sorts of diseases and ailments that last them
for the rest of their life or they just commit
suicide they just come in suicide so those are some
pretty good reasons to practice spirituality if it allows you
to transcend all that and it does it definitely does
in fact in a sense it's the only way that
you can trend all transcend all that stuff because all
that stuff is a construction of your own mind all
that stuff is a consequence of the false ways in
which you're living your life all the lies and self
deceptions and all the manipulative ego games you play well
that's all catching up with you the problem is that
most people are playing this game so to the hilt
so absorbed into this game but they don't even realize
that all these symptoms are symptoms of the way they're
playing the game they think that no leo this is
just how reality is it has to be this way
no it doesn't that's simply because you're playing the game
that way that it is that way just that is
a huge game changer to realize most people can't fathom
how it is they create all their own suffering and
all their own problems they think it's externally externally imposed
upon them by by some horrible world and then you
start to hate the world and blame the world for
all the evils and problems that exist there are no
evils and problems in the world it's all the construction
of your own mind and it's all a factor and
a function of how you've been playing the game so
if you hate the world and you think life is
terrible it's because you've been playing the game in the
wrong ways and I'm not blaming you for it I'm
just saying it is possible for you to wake up
to that that's actually a very positive truth because it
means you can awaken from it if only you're mature
enough to swallow that bitter pill and then roll up
your sleeves do some work another reason how spirituality is
another way the spirituality is useful and important is that
all of reality strives towards Union all of it not
just mankind not just your mind but all of reality
all creatures all businesses all governments all cultures everything that's
what evolution is evolution is fragmentation striving towards Union the
entire universe is striving towards the Union and so Union
means truth so when you ignore that and you say
[ __ ] Union I'm just gonna walk around fragmenting
everything I don't give a [ __ ] about the
truth what you're doing fundamentally is you are putting yourself
on the wrong side of evolution and on the wrong
side of history and you better believe you can get
punished by that by evolution for that for that kind
of arrogance when you align yourself with evolution with unification
rather than fragmentation then you put yourself in alignment with
evolution and with truth and then things go good for
you in life not perfectly there could still be horrible
mistakes and you know I'm not saying you're gonna be
perfect but it's certainly a lot better than if you
reject unification another reason and way that spirituality is useful
is universal love and compassion and true morality if you
care about these things then spirituality is basically the only
way you can get it you cannot be a truly
moral person without being highly conscious nor can you be
universally loving or compassionate it's impossible the ego will make
it impossible love is inversely proportional to ego morality is
inversely proportional to ego morality doesn't depend on how strictly
you control yourself depends on your level of consciousness so
if your level of conscious is low but you control
yourself a lot you're gonna fail to be a good
human being whereas if you have a high level of
consciousness but you don't control yourself at all you'll still
be a pretty good human being if you care about
peak human performance in sports in other domains in business
and art and elsewhere this comes from consciousness peak human
performance comes from being highly conscious within a specific domain
which requires spirituality if you care about ecology and holism
that requires consciousness if you want to be like a
child again if you had a good childhood think back
to what it was like to be seven ten years
old those magical years of your life where everything was
new and fresh and magical and beautiful and wonderful that's
because your mind wasn't filled with all the materialist dualistic
rationalist atheistic and cynical and other forms of beliefs and
ideas including of course all the religious nonsense you even
thought all the moralization that you've been taught all the
things you've been told not to do all the rules
all this all that that has robbed you of your
connection to reality which you actually had as a child
but then you lost through your teenage years through your
rocky adolescence and through your early 20s and 30s you
can get that back through spiritual practice so now you're
starting to see why people might take spiritual practice seriously
there are some people who take it really seriously who
devote their whole life to it those are the smart
ones because they realize just how significant this domain is
actually it's the most significant domain of your life it
can transform everything it can transform your life personally can
transform society everything it's all there the problem is that
nobody wants it or maybe rather nobody wants to pay
the horrible to go it cost that it takes to
acquire it let's wrap up by giving you this spirituality
test that I've devised this is a test to assess
how much spirituality is really right for you so it
requires very simple answers on your part it's a simple
questions so you're gonna be answering all these questions on
a scale of one to ten one being the lowest
ten being the highest so get out a piece of
paper and just jot down your numerical answers to these
questions okay so question number one is how much do
you care about the truth on a scale of one
to ten so if you care about it a lot
you put a 10 you don't care about it at
all but I want be honest how much do you
care about understanding existence how much do you care about
beauty with a capital B seeing Beauty everywhere everywhere you
look is beauty how much do you care about goodness
with a capital G being good and seeing goodness everywhere
how much do you care about being universally loving with
a capital L how much do you care about being
healthy not just physically healthy but emotionally healthy psychically healthy
and of course physically healthy how much do you care
about living in a healthy society in a healthy environment
how much do you care about overcoming anger fear anxiety
depression loneliness sadness jealousy how much do you care about
being authentic being authentically you without trying to please anybody
else without trying to be self-conscious and worrying about what
anybody thinks of you or how anyone judges you just
organically naturally yourself how much do you care about joy
and peace of mind how much do you care about
being ultra creative having amazing and profound insights whether it's
business art science philosophy spirituality or anything how much do
you care about exploring reality whether it's physically externally or
internally exploring your own mind exploring new realms of consciousness
how much does that excite you how much do you
love getting mind [ __ ] how much do you
love wisdom how much do you care about reducing the
suffering of mankind or even animals for that matter if
you're a fan of animals how much do you love
the feeling of being conscious thinking about some time in
your life when you were really conscious just consciousness purely
for consciousnesses sake is that something you love how much
do you want to be like a kid again how
much do you care about transcending dysfunction how much do
you want to go beyond petty human issues all the
mundane enos of life that you're in inundated with every
single day how much do you want to transcend those
how much do you want to be passionate about life
that's the whole quiz so take a look at your
answers if you have a lot of 10s and 9s
and eights across the board then spirituality is for you
and if you don't care about these things well then
stay away from spirituality so again now you can see
why spirituality is something that people pursue seriously that some
people devote their entire life to this is a very
wise strategic move if you're gonna be planning your whole
life from the very beginning to the very end it
would be a pretty wise move to say that you're
gonna invest a lot of your points your skill points
into spirituality but the problem is the sad fact is
is that most people do I mean most people don't
most people don't invest any points into spirituality they dump
their points into food sex shopping TV YouTube video games
porn etc etc and then they wonder why life sucks
well there you go there's your answer because you invested
your points into all the wrong areas and the one
right area we should invest them you dismissed it as
a stupid domain that wasn't worth your time well there's
your answer there's your problem right there reallocate your points
you can respect your character at any time it does
get harder as you get older but hey better late
than never right so now maybe you say Leo all
this sounds pretty nice I guess it makes sense but
I'm still skeptical I don't know I don't know it
sounds kind of fishy you're you're saying some things that
are pretty far out there how do I know you're
right how do I know you're not deluded you want
me just to believe you know you don't need to
believe me at all that's the beauty of the work
is that you do the work and in the work
is the result which self validating this is after all
a science which means that you're getting results and you're
seeing with your direct consciousness what's really going on this
is an inquiry skepticism is good you just need to
use it in the right way turn your skepticism inwards
on yourself and then begin the process of spirituality do
the research and do the practices don't have faith in
me you don't need to believe in any I say
but you do need to understand that to bootstrap yourself
in this process you have to like listen to some
teachings right because like think about it if you're trying
to learn a complex topic like let's say calculus and
you sat there in class as the teacher was teaching
you calculus and you cynically doubted everything the teacher said
every sentence the teacher said you just doubted and you
said well is that really true how could that be
true prove it to me where's the double-blind study that
this is true how do I know you're not full
of [ __ ] how do I know you're not
lying how do I know this isn't delusion how do
I know this is just whoo-whoo stuff if you take
that kind of attitude you're never gonna learn calculus you
need to have enough open-mindedness to be able to actually
do the research read the textbook go through the examples
go through the proofs think it through for yourself and
do the practices do the homework assignments only then can
you learn so that's what needs to happen here research
and practice your goal right now should be to have
your first mystical experience this is a critical turning point
in this journey have your first mystical experience only then
do you know what we're really talking about and even
then you don't know you just have a little glimpse
of something but at least you have some idea now
you have some inkling just like with sex you know
you need to have your first orgasm then you discover
the world of sex and that's an exciting world the
world of sexual that's an exciting to discover but you
haven't discovered it yet until you've had your first one
and if you want to do that quickly and effectively
what I recommend is LSD or mushrooms extremely effective for
doing this if used in the proper manner that's an
important qualification I have an episode called how to use
psychedelics for personal development you can go check that episode
out which goes through various points and important guidelines for
how to use psychedelics properly to have legitimate mystical experience
and how to interpret them properly I'll also shoot some
episodes in the future about how to how to really
go deep with psychedelics because I've been doing research on
this a lot both personally and theoretically practically and theoretically
and I have a lot of I think useful insights
very very practical insights for how to take your trips
really deep and so once you have that then you
have had your first mystical experience and now you understand
a little bit of what I'm talking about and now
you're ready to to actually start to do the serious
work so I'm not saying that LSD or mushrooms are
a shortcut and that you can use them to get
all the way I'm just saying it's a good entry
point to having your first mystical experience then you start
to understand then you start to take this stuff seriously
then you will really be invested in buying some books
watching some videos taking some courses traveling around the world
meeting the right people gurus this practices yoga blah blah
blah all these things and then then then you're good
then you're good now you're on your way there can
be no true spirituality without hardcore practice don't buy into
the lies and simple solutions that the new invites try
to give you where they say that there's nothing to
do there's no practices there's nothing hardcore you just you're
already enlightened don't buy into that nonsense if that were
true then what the [ __ ] would we be
doing here why am I here why am I talking
about this stuff this is true of course in other
sense it is true but you don't need to do
a lot of hardcore practice before you realize that true
from your point of view it's not true from their
point of view it's true from an enlightened person's point
of view that's true but not from an unenlightened person's
point of view in the same way that for a
calculus professor solving some calculus equation is really [ __
] easy because I already know the answer it's really
easy because they spent 20 years doing the practices and
have figured everything out so for them is really easy
but then when you give a child a calculus problem
it's impossible it's impossible you got to work up to
it now of course don't turn this into a limiting
belief as though you have to work for ten years
to have some your first mystical experience or something no
I mean dude as soon as you can so don't
waste your time it's gonna happen right now if it's
ever gonna happen but also be prepared to put in
the work and remember to educate yourself about this field
it's not enough just to do the practices it's not
enough to watch a few videos you need to do
some serious research some serious reading you need to read
at least 20 30 50 books on this topic to
really start to understand the various traps that are involved
in what you're really dealing with just conceptually to understand
let alone I'm not even talking about actually experiencing it
just to start to understand it because you're gonna be
very confused when you start you're not gonna know who's
right who's wrong you know mystical teachings can be notoriously
murky and confusing and tricky and that's because that's sort
of the nature of the beast that's not because the
teacher is deliberately trying to mislead you or trying to
be tricky or abstract that's just simply because we're working
it with your mind here in your mind is a
tricky Beast that's all that means so educate yourself properly
read the right books and if you need ideas for
that check out my book Lestat actualized that order alright
so that's it we're done here please click that like
button for me don't forget and then come check out
actualize that org there you'll find my book list my
blog were on posting interesting insights and videos additional exclusive
videos will be posted there soon and my life purpose
course is there come check out the forum you can
ask various questions and get guidance and advice and the
last thing I'll tell you is stick with me as
I release more content if you do I'll promise you
this if you take this work seriously you don't just
dabble in it B take it seriously you will come
out in a few years with a deeper understanding of
reality than professors and academics and PhDs at MIT and
Caltech and the best universities in the world you might
say Oh leo but this sounds outrageous how dare you
say such things this is so arrogant so cocky and
egotistical of you to make such claims how can you
possibly make such claims I'm not doing it from a
position of arrogance I'm just trying to make you aware
of the significance of this work the problem with these
professors and academics and all these top-notch research universities is
that they're extremely narrowly specialized and they're very siloed and
they take a very analytical non holistic approach to thinking
about their field and also they have consigned themselves to
this bureaucracy to this system so really even though they
might think that they're pursuing truth they're not and you
might think that they're pursuing truth but they're not what
they're pursuing is they're pursuing some narrow pragmatic scientific achievement
within their narrow little subspecialty which has nothing to do
with deep metaphysical existential truths so these professors whether they're
doing quantum mechanics or evolution or biology or chemistry or
anthropology or sociology or psychology whatever they surely have read
a ton of books and they know a lot of
facts they know a lot of technical minutia they could
out argue you and they can out debate you and
they can out cite you but what they can't do
is they can't actually explain what reality they don't know
they just don't know because they've consigned themselves to this
system this bureaucracy this academic ideology this materialism this rationalism
this desire to quantify all of reality this desire to
demystify all of reality academic philosophy there's almost no serious
metaphysics being done in universities today because it's groupthink it's
a bureaucracy you don't get paid to pursue the absolute
truth you get paid to deliver particular narrow results which
help the ego to survive whether it's the business ego
the academic ego or some other kind of ego mmm
that's what universities are about and there's nothing really wrong
with that we do need this technical knowledge so these
professors we still need them just don't think that they're
gonna be able to explain metaphysics to you because they
don't understand it themselves because they have tricked themselves into
thinking that it's worthless if there's nothing valuable valuable to
be found there and that it's just delusion well that's
their delusion is to think that metaphysics is delusion because
they don't know how to do metaphysics properly and even
the Philosopher's the ones and universities who are supposed to
be good at this stuff and are supposed to get
it they still don't get it this is rare stuff
so the reason I'm saying this is not to brag
but simply to remind you of the significance of what
is on offer here on this channel with actualized work
it's very rare and lucky that you found this resource
however you did you probably just stumbled upon it blindly
by accident and while that's extremely good fortune for you
because many of your friends never will there's a risk
the risk is that you've stumbled upon a pile of
gold but you're so myopic and lack so you like
vision so much that you are not going to be
able to appreciate what's here and you're not really gonna
take it seriously and act upon it and therefore you're
gonna miss out on the greatest thing that you could
find in reality so what I recommend is that you
really think about what's on offer here for free all
these hundreds of videos that I release for free that
meticulously break down all these topics in a way that
makes sense to scientifically minded rationally minded atheistic lis minded
people skeptically minded people because that's a that's where I
come from that's why I explain this stuff this way
because I know how to communicate to you because that's
how I think and that's how I thought and so
what I'm doing here is I'm building a bridge between
the spiritual realm and the analytical scientific realm that's what
I'm doing so we're gonna continue to do that there's
still a lot more topics to talk about they'll think
that we've covered everything yet there's always more there's hundreds
more I have lists of hundreds of topics that we
need to talk about very important topics that you still
have no clue about so we'll be covering those in
the months and years to come for however long I'm
doing this and if you stick with me you he'll
I'm telling you you will develop a deeper understanding of
reality of yourself of your mind of spirituality of metaphysics
of science even you will understand science better than the
top-notch scientists in universities that doesn't mean you're gonna understand
their specific specialty better it means you're gonna understand science
as a whole because you're gonna understand how the human
mind works and the way paradigms work you're gonna understand
that better than these professors and academics and if you
are one of these professors and academics and scientists watch
out be careful because there's a very good reason that
this stuff is not taught in universities it's not compatible
with what's taught in universities so if you think that
you're gonna bring this into a university environment and watch
out they don't tolerate mysticism they don't tolerate spirituality that's
not by accident that's by design that's by design they're
gonna tar and feather you and demonize you they're not
gonna give you ten ER tenure you're not gonna have
a successful career because you can't do this in a
bureaucracy if you could religion would be successful can't do
it truth doesn't work that way truth is a deeply
personal thing and it's a very radical thing and you
got to be a maverick to pursue the truth you
know when I was really into philosophy I seriously thought
about becoming a philosophy professor that's really what I should
have been instead I became actualized that orient and I'm
so glad I became actualized that'll work and actually this
was done by design the reason I didn't become a
philosopher professionally a professor philosophy is because I saw when
I was about 20 years old and I was making
a decision I very clearly saw that I would not
be allowed to pursue the truth in its full glory
in a university setting and so I said to myself
well that answers the question about whether I want to
be a flaw professor or not and so I didn't
go into that because I knew that if I did
I would consign myself to a life of misery and
delusion and I'm really glad for making that choice the
only reason that we can do what I'm doing here
today is precisely because I'm independent precisely because I'm not
beholden to any kind of advertisers or money interests or
universities bureaucracies or anything like that because if I were
then that's what corrupts the truth so you got to
put the truth number one if you're a truth seeker
which means that if you're gonna do that you got
to make yourself independent so they're not somebody's little [
__ ] and you got to jump through their little
[ __ ] Hoops in life earning crumbs so that
you can just barely survive see most people consigned themselves
to wage slavery in one system or another and then
what happens is that they don't have time they don't
have the luxury to pursue the truth because there's some
one's a little [ __ ] for the rest of
your life until they retire maybe and by that point
they're too old it's too late their mind is too
dull they don't care anymore they're so depressed and miserable
that they're lost cause but anyways so now you understand
what's at stake let me shoot make sure you stick
around and more exciting stuff to come you
