hey this is Leo for Ashe lized org and in
this episode I'm going to be talking about the dark
side of meditation please tell me that by this point
you have a meditation practice installed in your life where
you're meditating every single day for however many minutes please
tell me you've got that going if you don't this
is the number one habit that you can install in
your life that will completely transform everything you cannot be
following actualise org and not meditating all right that's not
going to work because the stuff I'm gonna be talking
about in the future and already much of the stuff
I'm talking about is going completely over your head because
you have no idea what awareness or what consciousness really
are and how little of it you have unless you
started meditating so that's for the newbies but what I'm
talking about in this episode is really some advice for
those of you who already installed the habit have been
meditating and are now starting to reach into the intermediate
and the advanced stages of meditation so this means you've
been meditating consistently every single day for at least six
months or 12 months or a couple of years and
then what's going to happen is weird stuff will arise
as you meditate and you will discover perhaps in a
shocking way that meditation is not all rainbows and butterflies
the way you initially assumed some of the stuff that
comes up is freaky weird downright alien and very negative
sometimes and it can blindside you and sabotage your meditation
habit so what I'm going to talk about here is
the dark side stuff that's counterintuitive stuff that you would
not expect to arise from a simple meditation habit so
what is this stuff well there's a whole list now
before I tell you all this stuff I want to
preface it by saying that you're not necessarily going to
encounter all this so don't go hunting for it because
a lot of this stuff can be negative and if
you don't experience it that's fine these are like side
effects right if a drug has side effects that means
it can happen it doesn't mean that it will happen
to you but if it does happen to you a
lot of this stuff is very common don't be surprised
you've been warned so firstly expect hyper annoyance and crankiness
this is very common and usually it comes in spells
like you're meditating for weeks for weeks everything's going great
you're becoming more calm and more peaceful and then you
reach one week in your meditation routine where you're just
annoyed by everything hyper annoyed by little little tiny insignificant
things that you would think you're totally beyond like the
air conditioning or the humming of your refrigerator will start
to annoy the hell out of you or maybe your
cat or your dog will start to annoy the hell
out of you for no reason no good reason and
that might take you by surprise or you just become
cranky and you have this kind of spell of crankiness
that lasts for a few days or for an entire
week or maybe for an entire month also expect hyper
judgmentalism when you become hyper judgmental of everyone around you
especially people that are close to you like your family
your spouse your girlfriend your boyfriend your children and so
forth expect that that will come about in spells again
might last for a few days my lasts for a
week might last for a whole month and I don't
want you to be blindsided by that expect wild mood
swings up and down and up and down mood swings
that can last from days to weeks where you feel
terrible or you feel really high like you're on cloud
nine because you've been meditating now and you're getting growth
and everything's feeling wonderful and you think that that's just
how it is now that's your new level you think
you've arrived but then a few weeks pass then you
crash into some deep depression and you wondered yourself no
no I lost it what happened I thought I arrived
but see that was just a wrong expectation the fact
is you will have many wild mood swings throughout your
entire meditation career so get used to that also expect
feelings of loneliness to come over you sometimes expect feelings
of disgust anger and frustration and these can vary from
very mild forms of these emotions to very very heavy
forms where you just feel like you're the most lonely
isolated human being on the entire surface of the earth
or you're just completely pissed off and angry about the
the political party and what it's doing to the country
or whatever right so this stuff will happen to you
if you're going to be meditating for years expect crying
sometimes you will cry totally and fine nothing wrong with
that expect insomnia sometimes you're going to have these manic
episodes where we have a lot of energy come up
and you're not going to be able to fall asleep
because you're excited to either by new possibilities or you're
agitated or anxious about something that might happen expect depression
and meaninglessness to wash over you I can almost guarantee
that if you're going to meditate for longer than a
year that you will be hit by some serious spells
of depression and that's totally normal that's par for the
course and you will at times feel like your entire
life is meaningless everything you've done is meaningless your family
is meaningless your career is meaningless your relationships are meaningless
even meditation is meaningless and self-improve it as meaningless all
of this you'll you'll experience all this stuff this is
just par for the course also expect to have interference
with your work in your career from your meditation habit
you're going to be meditating men meditating and then all
of a sudden you realize like my work in my
career it's so meaningless why am i putting all this
effort and all this emotional labor into it and so
you might want to quit your career or you might
get disgusted by it or whatever that's totally normal and
usually that comes and it passes so the trick with
all these things is to not get triggered by them
and then to make some sort of rash move as
a reaction against just this emotional energy this negative emotional
energy or this fear or this self-doubt that's bubbling up
from inside of you right because that's what meditation is
doing is it it's surfacing stuff from your deep subconscious
mind and that stuff comes up to the surface but
if you don't expect that then that's when you can
get into trouble because you will then react against that
stuff which is largely illusory but then you're reacting to
it that can cause some real damage in your life
also expect interference with relationships especially your closest intimate relationship
with your spouse or your girlfriend or boyfriend and also
your family relationships right you might feel like oh what
am i doing in this room I am even married
to this person then we're such a wrong match and
you're going to get all this kind of self-doubt going
that's totally normal expect some rash judgments like you might
feel like oh okay I gotta quit my job and
I got to get a divorce I gotta drop my
family and my children and I got to move to
a cave at India you might have some sort of
fantasy like that come into your mind while you're meditating
and then you think like okay that's what I got
to do now and then you go I actually do
it and the mistake is to act on that too
quickly without letting that plan or this fantasy just kind
of like work its way through you usually what'll happen
is it'll pass in a few days so be aware
that and other kinds of rash judgments you might have
a rash judgment to sell your IRA and to to
liquidate all your stocks and all your assets and to
donate all that money to charity and then if you
act on that too quickly you might come to regret
that also expect suicidal thoughts I can almost guarantee that
if you are meditating effectively you will have more suicidal
thoughts than you've probably ever had in your life and
that's if you're a normal person I'm not talking about
suicidal people I'm talking about totally normal people me from
my meditation habit I never have really suicidal thoughts but
from my meditation habit alone the more I meditate the
more suicidal thoughts I have and that's totally fine I
recognize that I don't take them very seriously and therefore
they don't bother me but someone who's not expecting that
could get freaked out by that and could actually maybe
think that they're going to take action on it which
could become a problem expect some freak out moments some
days you just start to freak out and you're not
even sure why you get into an argument with your
spouse or with your children for no good reason you're
just blaming them for stuff or you're just a jet√©
today them you're snapping at them you're being passive-aggressive this
sort of stuff that could happen definitely expect ego backlash
this will surely happen to you at one point or
another and it'll happen many times and what I mean
by ego backlash is that as you're meditating you're dissolving
your ego over time that's basically what you're doing but
when the ego gets dissolved too much too fast what
it does is it tends to come back with even
more force than it had before and when it does
it starts to really behave in nasty petty egotistical ways
which is exactly why you might start to get into
arguments with people that otherwise you shouldn't have gotten into
you might turn back to old habits that you've worked
through already like you might go binging on ice cream
and on greasy food even though you've already cleaned up
your diet you might go binge on television even though
you've stopped watching television for years you might go start
doing drugs again or alcohol or smoking cigarettes even though
you haven't done that for years you might go on
a sex binge and go sleep with a bunch of
random strangers on one-night stands even though you don't usually
do that you might get addicted to money again maybe
you've weaned yourself off the pursuit of money and the
pursuit of success in business and then you've been meditating
a lot and all the sudden it's like oh my
business I got to get back to my business on
it it's earn more money and then you'll go and
start chasing that again so this is all stuff that
I call ego backlash and this can feel demoralizing because
it feels like you're taking a step backwards because here
you are meditating for years and now you're eating junk
food doing drugs and chasing money again like what what's
this about I thought I was supposed to be growing
and becoming more spiritual and it seems like I'm just
regressing but that's just a phase that's something you have
to work through and go further and what I've noticed
is that every time I have a strong ego backlash
if I am mindful and vigilant of it and just
kind of sort of avoid the most negative behaviors try
to limit the most negative behaviors possible with that backlash
and just kind of monitor it then usually within a
couple of weeks it dissolves and then I'm back better
than ever right so with all these things you have
to understand that these are temporary and when we're told
that meditation makes us more spiritual makes us more aware
dissolves our ego and all this other good stuff that
makes us calmer and happier that's true but only in
the long run is that true that's not true in
the short run that's where people really go wrong is
that they assume is just going to be straighforward positive
linear progression from the moment they start meditating and that's
just completely unrealistic expect hyper horniness sometimes you can be
meditating meditating and maybe you've got off porn and you
stop having frivolous sex and then you just have this
spell of incredible horniness and you want to like jerk
off every day or you want to go have sex
with a bunch of people and it's like you can't
get it out of your system it's just like you
feel like this there's this like horniness coursing through you
that will happen expect old repressed memories to come bubbling
up stuff that you have completely forgotten about stuff you
might think you've worked through it's gonna be some traumatic
stuff especially if you had traumas in your childhood stuff
that you've repressed stuff that was very negative maybe examples
like abuse sexual abuse any kinda like near-death experiences that
you've had um bullying humiliation embarrassment like all this kind
of stuff that you would normally not want to think
about that will come bubbling up also family stuff will
come bubbling up because many of your memories the earliest
memories you have are of your childhood and especially if
you had a turbulent childhood which wasn't all rainbows and
butterflies then definitely expect that stuff to come up and
definitely expect all sorts of family issues like mommy issues
daddy issues sibling rivalries resentments like all that kind of
stuff it'll all come up expect crazy monkey mind expect
sometimes to have waves of insanity and madness wash over
you where you just feel like your mind is like
a swarming hive of bees and the more you try
to control it the less you control the more out-of-control
it gets and you just sit down you try to
meditate you try to do your normal technique and nothing
is working none of your normal techniques of working expect
self-doubt where you start to doubt yourself you start to
doubt your technique like this technique has been working for
months and now it just feels like oh man this
technique it stopped working it's not working anymore expect that
expect nightmares expect weird dreams where in your dreams you're
living out weird fantasies like having sex with your mother
or you know killing people or the you know butchering
your dog with a cleaver or something like that like
you know unpleasant images in your mind when you're sleeping
that will come up and expect spiritual arrogance where you
start to believe that oh yeah I've been meditating for
a few years now look at how unconscious everybody else
is around me look at look at all the unconscious
stuff they do and so you're going to develop that
and you're going to probably go around and preach to
those people and you're going to tell them look you
should do what I'm doing meditate more and then you'll
you'll experience all this good stuff that I'm experiencing but
later you'll recognize that all that's just me at an
intermediate stage thinking that I'm at the highest stage but
then later I realize that all this that was just
an intermediate stage it wasn't nearly the highest stage that
spiritual arrogance was actually a function of my unconsciousness and
so that will happen to you now this whole list
of stuff this is all quite common stuff this is
stuff that you should definitely expect don't be surprised at
all if it happens to you and not just once
but repeatedly in fact what you should start noticing is
that it's a recurrent theme throughout long term meditation is
that this stuff starts coming up and some of it
is very subtle sometimes this stuff happens to you and
you're not even making an immediate connection between you getting
into a fight with your spouse and that stemmed from
your meditation practice see sometimes it's not an obvious connection
you only recognize it two days later after you've already
gotten into a big argument because you went unconscious and
you forgot about these warning signs that I gave you
now what's going on here why is there this negative
stuff with meditation is it meditation supposed to just make
a spiritual and more conscious well it's a battle it's
a battle think about what's actually happening when you're meditating
and when you're growing to grow means you have to
shed old patterns old memories old beliefs old thought patterns
and how does that happen well your mind which is
the entire collection of all that stuff for it to
grow it needs to defragment itself and rearrange itself into
a higher order smoother functioning system and how does it
do that by purging and working through and defragmenting all
the [ __ ] that's in your mind and if
you're like the ordinary individual in mainstream society then your
mind is filled with so much [ __ ] that
you don't even know how much is in there it's
everything you were taught since you were a kid it's
all the media that you ingested it's all your religious
scientific and political beliefs it's everything your parents told you
is everything your teachers told you it's all the silly
ideas that you thought were true when you were growing
up all the mistakes you've made all the incorrect intuitions
all your fears all that stuff and that's the deep
core of your mind you're not conscious of most of
that stuff so when you're meditating you're actually forcing your
mind not to consciously work through that but to unconsciously
work through that you are like literally defragmenting a hard
drive but unlike therapy where you go to a therapist
for years and you sit down on the couch and
you talk and talk and talk about your problems that's
logical that's conscious when you're meditating the exact same thing
is happening as in therapy but it's happening automatically unconsciously
in your mind and the only signs of it that
you're going to experience are these emotional swells these mood
swings these reactions this horniness this depression the sense of
meaninglessness that's how it's going to bubble up and you've
got to be smart enough and vigilant enough and conscious
enough to be aware that that's what's happening here on
the bigger picture always keep the bigger picture in mind
and this is the best reframe you can have for
this stuff is to see it as actually purging this
is actually called spiritual purification you're purifying and purging all
the toxic thoughts and emotions and that process isn't always
pleasant but what's great about purification is at once the
purification process completes itself then you're left with a relatively
clean pure substance and then that is what is gonna
be you five 10 15 years from now so you're
not purified after a week of meditation you're purified after
a decade of meditation and the purification it comes in
waves it's like you're purifying yourself for a few weeks
for a few months and then some big obstacle comes
in your way and you've got to really work through
that and purge a lot of stuff and that's when
you have your emotional freak-outs and mood swings and then
you purge that stuff after weeks and then you get
back and things are going nice and smooth and now
you're working at a higher level of consciousness until you
head the next obstacle and then again there's going to
be a few weeks of turmoil and then the next
obstacle and then the next obstacle next obstacle that's going
to continue for years that's actually what you're aiming at
with meditation see so the way that I reframe this
in my mind is I tell myself when I'm experiencing
something negative I tell myself oh this is actually a
sign that I'm growing and that the process is working
and I'm excited by that and that is enough to
mollify any kind of depression that I have or any
kind of like self-doubt that I have about this whole
process and that allows me to stay on track now
you might think that that's bad enough but actually I
haven't gotten yet to the weirdest stuff what I talked
about so far is I gave you a list of
the common stuff now let me give you a list
of the really weird [ __ ] some of this
stuff is incredible you won't believe it's possible until it
happens to you so here's some of the weird side
effects of meditation you can expect tingling jerking shaking and
various pains throughout your body that feel very real you
can expect seeing lights and auras bright lights of various
kinds with your eyes open or with your eyes closed
and they can be animated that can be very beautiful
or very scary in medicine and they can look very
lifelike you can also expect to see vivid sexual fantasies
you might even see fantasies of the opposite pole of
your sexuality so if you're heterosexual you might start to
see homosexual fantasies and they might be completely lifelike not
just a little daydream but like fully lifelike and of
course those will tend to seduce you off the path
you might start to behave like an animal like literally
you might start to scratch yourself like an animal or
crawl around on your knees or even howl howling like
a wolf oh can you imagine that you're sitting there
meditating for weeks and then one day you just have
this uncontrollable urge to start howling like a wolf and
as you're doing that your spouse walks in the door
yeah that's pretty awkward and now you got some explaining
to do and they look at you like you're going
insane what is this meditation thing you're doing it's turning
you into an animal so expect that I'm not saying
that it'll necessarily happen to you but if it does
don't be surprised by it is what I'm saying also
expect paranormal phenomena to happen to you what do I
mean by this that means reliving the past having past
live experiences or seeing the future having weird deja vu
experiences having full out-of-body experiences where you actually leave your
body in a totally lifelike way and you travel to
some sort of astral realm or different parts of the
world and interact with various kinds of entities you might
see spirits or hear spirits you might hear weird voices
in your head and they can be totally lifelike not
imagined but totally lifelike you might actually see angels and
demons again not imagined but like standing before you completely
real as real as I look to you now but
it's going to be an angel or [ __ ]
demon like out of a movie you might see gods
deities giant crawling insects praying mantis people spirit animals that
talk to you try to tell you things or maybe
that try to kill you try to clot you you
might see entities you might see aliens you might feel
like you're being channeled by some sort of extraterrestrial or
that you're getting abducted or probed and all these experiences
are not just like mere dreams like a nightmare it
can be a lot more realistic feeling and looking than
that so that's pretty weird and it's pretty far out
but all this stuff is possible and the reason it'll
blindside you is because your present model of reality if
you haven't meditated for long periods of time is that
all this stuff is fiction and it's not possible I
mean how could this stuff be possible but see you
underestimate the power of your limited consciousness when your consciousness
rises weird [ __ ] that you've never imagined all
of a sudden starts to become possible you start to
become a lot more open-minded than you ever thought you
would be and when this weird [ __ ] starts
happening to you well if you have this kind of
dogmatic insistence that it's not possible this is not supposed
to happen then you can imagine the sort of shock
that you will be in also you might have Samadhi
States these are quite common usually quite positive but also
they might shock you a little bit a Samadhi state
is when you actually stop existing as an individual body
and you actually merge with objects like you might be
looking at a lamp and you might actually merge and
become that lamp you might be looking at a car
and merge and become that car you might be looking
at your spouse or your children and actually become your
children literally and now my freaked you out but generally
this is something that's positive and you're actually should be
anticipating that if you're doing serious meditation you can even
have a samadhi experience of emptiness or nothingness where you
merge not with an object but with nothing nothing at
all you might also experience a Kundalini awakening which can
be a freaky thing a Kundalini awakening is when energy
in your body gets concentrated then it sort of shoots
up your spine into your head and then it explodes
out of your head and that can be a very
powerful experience it can be beautiful but also it can
be terrifying because it might feel like you're losing your
mind and you actually have this weird energy moving through
you and you start to behave as though your body
is being controlled by a puppet master like you're not
even in control of your body anymore your body is
just moving on its own and you have no idea
what the hell is controlling you it's almost like you've
been possessed also you might experience a total blackout or
the void in Buddhism one way that they describe a
attainment on the path towards enlightenment is something called neither
perception nor non-perception which is a state or you're sitting
there and you're concentrating and meditating and then there's like
a total uh erasure of reality physical reality stops existing
for a while now in physical reality time that might
be just a few seconds but in your time as
you're sitting there and experiencing this it might feel like
an eternity like the entire world has vanished and disappeared
and including your body and including yourself and you're just
sitting there as the void that might be pretty freaky
also of course expect ego death if you're serious about
meditation that's probably why you're doing in the first place
to experience ego death so this would be something to
look forward to but also ego death can be scary
can be freaky because it's probably not anything you imagined
it to be your sense of reality will get shattered
and it will expand in ways that are beyond your
wildest imagination and the question is will you be open
to that or are you not expecting it and then
that will really freak you out and probably the worst
thing that can happen to you is the dark night
of the soul which is basically when you start to
see that everything you've ever believed a note about reality
is false and completely delusional and you start to realize
that reality is meaningless and purposelessness and purpose lists has
no purpose it has no meaning and that all your
um old creature comforts and everything that you attached yourself
to all the meanings that you assigned to your family
to your career to money to your marriage to your
children even to self-improvement even to meditation even to the
pursuit of enlightenment when you realize that all this is
completely meaningless and you start to interpret that as a
negative thing you can get into the spiral of depression
that can get very dark and it's called the dark
night of the soul now this isn't common but it
can happen and in the worst situation it can lead
to this depersonalization disorder where you actually start to feel
like you don't exist as a person and you interpret
that whole thing as negative but there's ways out of
depersonalization disorder and there's ways out of the dark soul
so again generally speaking all this stuff that I'm talking
about you want to treat it as temporary phases as
just arisings or a bubbling up from your subconscious mind
of stuff stuff that you need to work through so
none of this is really ultimately negative it's actually all
very positive stuff but in the moment for a few
days for a few weeks it can feel very negative
all right so what do we do about all this
stuff what's the recommendation well if you talk to a
serious meditation teacher or master or an enlightened master their
advice on this stuff is actually very simple it's actually
very easy to give good meditation advice here it is
firstly just relax and realize that all this stuff is
normal and that really it's no different than any other
phenomenon that you're seeing around you seeing an alien is
no different than seeing my face it really doesn't matter
you're just attributing a different meaning to an alien because
it's an alien than to my face and if you're
seeing a demon or an angel recognize that it's no
different than seeing your car or seeing your mother or
seeing a chipmunk at the park right it's really no
different the only difference is the meaning that you assigned
to it and of course all your meetings are self
constructed and a lot of them come from the ego
so as you start to unravel your ego this sort
of weird [ __ ] will stop bothering you so
much the way it does normal people so just relax
that's step number one step number two remember don't get
distracted by this stuff remember what's going on here is
that your ego is trying to maintain its sense of
tyranny over your life it's like you're trying to depose
a dictator so when you're deposed in a dictator what
do you think happens there's resistance right he fights back
because he doesn't want to get deposed neither does your
ego your ego and your mind and your brain are
trying to maintain homeostasis so as you're pulling towards spiritual
higher consciousness it's pulling back in full force towards lower
consciousness towards egotism and the way that it does that
is by sending these strong negative emotions at you getting
you to be afraid and by trying to distract you
from your ultimate goal and the only thing you got
to do to stay on track is just to keep
meditating that's really it stay relaxed keep your cool and
just keep meditating if you start to break your meditation
habits that's when you know the ego has really won
okay because that's all the ego wants the ego wants
to sabotage you to get you to stop so that
it can remain the tyrant in power remember that all
this negative stuff is just a sign of real growth
real growth doesn't always feel pretty the way you imagined
newbies think of growth is positive stuff advanced practitioners know
that growth growth is tough and that it requires a
emotional labor that's what tells that meditation is real and
not just a fantasy because you are working through and
it takes emotional labour to focus and to keep yourself
on track and to not get distracted remind yourself that
this is a phase depression is a phase seeing weird
entities and aliens and demons and stuff that's a phase
all this is stuff you will pass through it's not
going to last forever remember to trust yourself trust your
higher self trust your original motivations for why you started
doing meditation if you have a a thirst for enlightenment
trust in that there's something there that will cut through
all the [ __ ] all the fear all the
egotism all so treat yourself with love and kindness on
this journey meditation is not about disciplining yourself harshly and
self-flagellation it's supposed to be a process of self-love you're
doing this out of compassion love for yourself so when
you sit down to meditate be kind be gentle on
yourself both mentally and physically it does no good for
you to start to argue with yourself inside your mind
to start to create partitions in your mind where you
say oh this part of me is bad and this
part of me is good and the good part needs
to discipline the bad part no all of that is
just more ego games so a lot of times when
I am very frustrated or I'm going through some sort
of turbulent stuff during my meditation I just remember that
hey let me just calm down and relax let me
accept all this stuff let me not resist any of
it because you know what I know that in the
bigger picture I have no control over it at all
all my negative emotions that come up I have zero
control over it and when I'm meditating well I have
zero control over that my only job is just to
sit here and to be mindful that's it and the
self love is so deep that if I feel like
I need a short break I will take a short
break I will meditate less you could even stop meditating
for a week if you really need to like if
you feel like this meditation is completely destroying your career
in your relationship make a calculated strategic move to take
a break for a short time but then of course
with always the intention to come back because the greatest
failure you could experience as if you get fed up
and discuss it with meditation then you never want to
come back anymore then you've let the ego win it
accomplished a job and the last thing I would suggest
is to read spiritual books read books from people who
have meditated for decades who can give you some tips
and pointers and they could keep you inspired they can
keep you connected with your original motivation for why you're
meditating and they could point out the different traps to
you and the different ways that you can deal with
those traps so that if you do ever experience a
dark night of the soul for example you know which
book to go to where there's going to be a
bunch of advice that tells you how to deal with
a dark night of the soul you don't want to
get caught off guard by that all right that's it
those are my tips meditation does have a dark side
but remember that actually the bigger the dark side the
bigger the purer the spiritual purification that you will experience
and the higher your consciousness will ultimately go so all
this stuff is ultimately very positive so don't despair stay
on track and if you don't have a meditation have
it yet make sure you install it first thing starting
today or starting tomorrow all right I'm signing off post
