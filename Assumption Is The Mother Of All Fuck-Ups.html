[Music] in this episode we're going to be discussing assumptions
and the crucial role that they play within epistemology this
is going to be a foundational epistemic episode i talk
about epistemology a lot epistemology just basically means how do
we know what we know it's the principles behind the
gathering of accurate knowledge or understanding of reality and that's
very important as you're trying to grow and develop yourself
because if you don't have an accurate understanding of reality
or you have various kinds of self-deceptions and epistemic errors
within your worldview that's going to distort how you go
about developing yourself and try to be successful in life
and so a lot of the failures that come very
practically in your life whether you're trying to start a
business or you're trying to get romantic with somebody in
a relationship or you're trying to educate yourself you're trying
to do spirituality whatever you're trying to do that comes
with hidden assumptions and epistemic errors and self-deceptions which then
lead to lots of failure and misery and suffering so
that's why this topic is so practical and important so
assumption lies at the heart of all epistemic error self-deception
and untruthfulness these are topics that i've covered a lot
in the past go check out my three-part series called
self-deception part one part two part three so this episode
is going to connect with that and really with all
my other epistemic episodes what i want to highlight here
for you right off the bat is that there's a
deep connection between survival and assumptions and in a certain
sense we can boil all of the problems of epistemology
and self-deception down to making assumptions and there's some deep
reasons for why that connection exists make sure you go
watch my previous episodes called understanding survival part one and
part two i've talked about survival a lot and so
now we're gonna be connecting survival with epistemology and with
assumption making all right my notion remember my notion of
survival is a much broader deeper notion than what most
people mean when they say survival i don't just mean
you gathering food and water i'm talking about pretty much
all of the activity you do in your life i
call that survival all right so look at how this
works epistemically speaking you are born into a position of
total ignorance that's where you begin life and you are
a finite consciousness finite consciousness means that you don't have
all the available information or understanding of the universe in
other words you're not omniscient and you certainly weren't when
you were born but because you consider yourself to be
alive and you have a bias towards living that bias
automatically puts you into a sort of existential bind where
now you're committed to survival survival demands that you make
choices and actions regardless of the fact that you don't
have all the information and that you're in a position
of deep ignorance life requires action survival requires action you
don't have time to go and gather perfect information about
any situation that's what makes life so challenging and at
the same time interesting if you knew everything perfectly if
you were omniscient action in all situations would be so
easy that it wouldn't even be meaningful or interesting because
you would know the the best possible action you could
take but that's not how life is life is like
it's like playing a game like an rts game with
the fog of war there's this fog of war it's
the fog of ignorance it's the fog of a lack
of omniscience you don't see the entire map and that's
actually what makes the game interesting because if you saw
all the units on the map and you knew all
the hit points and you knew all the resistance and
you knew all the stats there would be nothing to
discover you'd be omniscient you'd be god and then you'd
be in god mode and in god mode there's no
game to be played so survival means you must act
or you die that's the position that you're put in
when you're born therefore you must make assumptions to make
sense of reality and to act within it because you
need to figure out which way to act because there
are thousands of different ways you could act in various
situations and some of those can easily get you killed
in fact probably the majority of ways you can act
in a situation will get you killed and only a
small select few actions will not get you killed or
will get you actual success in that particular situation and
will enhance your survival and maybe even lead to you
thriving so see what happens because of this very fundamental
existential sort of buying that we're putting in just by
being the fact that we're born there's an upside and
a downside to this the upside of making assumptions is
that you gain short-term utility you make an assumption about
a situation this pairs down the number of choices you
have the human mind uses various kinds of heuristics tries
to make sense of a situation tries to simplify a
situation because most situations are pretty complex with hundreds of
variables the human mind can't deal with all that information
all those variables most of those variables are unknown or
unpredictable and rather chaotic they don't follow simple linear logical
rules it's kind of hairy and messy and fuzzy and
so you just use a sort of a simplified model
to make sense of something the upside of that is
that you can take short-term action quickly the downside of
that is that you sacrifice truthfulness there opens up a
greater potential for epistemic error and so what you need
to recognize that survival has forced you to make a
sort of a devil's bargain of utility over truth and
what is the truth well the truth is that you
don't know not knowing is the real truth the reality
is that 99.999 percent of the universe you don't know
you only know a very tiny percentage of the universe
and it's even worse than that because even that tiny
percentage that you think you know even that you don't
fully know a lot of that is wrong too you
see and so if you were truly honest you would
just admit in every situation that you're in that god
i just don't know i don't know what the right
course of action is i don't know what i should
do but see you can't admit that because survival makes
not knowing unacceptable from the point of view of survival
not knowing is not an option if you don't know
then you got to take a best guess but here's
what happens is that here's the kicker is that the
more utility that your assumptions have the less likely you
are to question them down the road as time passes
precisely because they're useful which gets you to rationalize to
yourself that oh well if this assumption is useful and
it works and i'm able to survive and even thrive
by using this set of assumptions then what's the problem
you see and so here your life becomes so utilitarian
that you forget that there even is such a thing
as truth leah why would truth even matter as long
as i'm getting the utility i want out of my
assumptions that's the trap here that most people fall into
because the survival pressures on a human being are so
strong that most of us barely make it by life
we barely survive and even those people who are thriving
you might say well but like celebrities and rich business
people they're thriving they don't have this problem yes they
do because even though some rich celebrity or whatever you
might think that they're they're doing great they have no
problems actually they have just as many problems as you
even bigger problems and they're still struggling to survive as
that celebrity or as that rich person you know a
billionaire is struggling to survive as a billionaire every single
day that's what poor people don't understand it takes a
lot of energy to maintain your billionaire status and you
have to worry about losing the money where are you
going to put the money who's going to steal your
money who's going to kidnap your children to ransom the
money from you you know these are these are the
kind of problems that billionaires think about in the morning
um and so you're not out of survival just because
you're a billionaire not at all and in fact the
more successful you become the more of a celebrity you
become the more fame you acquire the more material wealth
you acquire the more money you have the more sex
you're able to get through your various kinds of assumptions
the more easy it will be for you to rationalize
to yourself that there's no problem at all and that
your assumptions are truth because leo if it wasn't true
how could i have a billion dollars because of it
if it wasn't true how come i'm getting laid so
easily if it wasn't true how come you know i
have a giant house and a fast car and i'm
doing great for myself but maybe you're acquiring all those
things so easily precisely because you're aligning yourself against the
truth with falsehood see don't assume that success and truth
are the same thing see already i'm pointing out one
assumption to you this is actually sort of a meta
assumption we'll get to that in a minute and i'm
going to give you a very long list here of
various kinds of assumptions that you should be thinking about
so the reality is that you hold hundreds and thousands
of assumptions and you use them every day just to
function in your life these assumptions can be very ordinary
simple assumptions or they can be rather abstract sorts of
meta assumptions metaphysical assumptions we'll get into those as well
those are really the interesting ones but even just the
very practical ones are also important so this episode about
assumptions it's not purely metaphysics here although we're going to
get into that we're going to get into spirituality and
issues of science and so forth but uh i want
you to start to notice that just even even the
simple act of walking into your house and flipping the
light switch and expecting that light switch to turn on
the lights that is an assumption you have you're assuming
that flipping a switch is going to turn on the
lights and um and you make hundreds and thousands of
these assumptions every single day and while it works a
lot of the time sometimes it doesn't work and sometimes
it gets you into real trouble and sometimes it gets
you really stuck in life it can get you stuck
with your dating situation it can get you stuck with
your marriage or your relationships it can get you stuck
with your children raising your children it can get you
stuck with your business with your health with your finances
with investing we'll get into all those practical topics here
soon so um and the other the other domain where
this is so important is with science i've talked about
this before in my series deconstructing the myth of science
part one two three where we talk about various kinds
of assumptions that science makes um and we'll be going
over those here as well um but you see one
of the biggest problems with science is precisely because it's
so effective and it's got so much utility and yet
it has so many assumptions that science has to make
in order to attain that level of utility that once
the utility is there and we can build amazing technology
using that utility various kinds of models and theories and
equations then it's very easy for scientists and the rest
of our society to put science on a pedestal and
to assume that science is equivalent to truth because hey
if it wasn't true how can we build all this
amazing technology using it therefore it's true right wrong of
course and so the problem becomes that it becomes so
useful that it's difficult to even get scientists or normies
so to speak to start to question or even to
care to question the foundations of science like leo why
even bother questioning it it just works well as i've
explained in that series deconstructing the myth of science there's
very good reasons to question it because the bottom line
is that any assumptions you hold which are false but
which you think are true which get you utility and
increase your survival there's going to be karmic consequences for
that there's always karmic consequences for false understanding for false
assumptions it leads to epistemic errors and these errors are
not just within the domain of philosophy these errors will
be felt in your life they will be felt they
will affect your emotional system they will either make you
depressed or angry or jealous or sad or suicidal they
will affect your ability to construct a business to find
meaning and love in your life to to do spiritual
work and many other practical things like this your health
for example you know a lot of people make assumptions
about nutrition nutrition science tends to be very sketchy nutrition
science is not very good science uh we still need
hundreds of more years of science on nutrition to really
get solid understanding of what is and isn't healthy for
you and different people have different requirements for what uh
what's healthy for them and not and so a lot
of people get stuck in these sorts of fad diets
they think that they're eating food that is actually healthy
but it isn't very practical stuff so anyways in this
way epistemic rot can lurk deep within any world view
and of course i'm not picking on science here i
mean religious people make a [ __ ] ton of
assumptions which oftentimes end up being false so religion suffers
from this problem too uh philosophers make a lot of
assumptions as well when they're doing their philosophy which leads
to bad philosophy and bad world views whether you're a
nihilist or you're an existentialist or you're an atheist or
you're a materialist or an idealist whatever philosophy you subscribe
to uh for example within economics economists make all sorts
of oversimplifications and assumptions about how people make purchasing decisions
the way that the economy works and that's also very
sketchy a sketchy sort of form of science you might
almost call economics pseudoscience um because it's so so fuzzy
and murky and there's a lot of assumptions that go
into that and of course within politics there's a lot
of assumptions within politics the definition of an assumption is
quote a thing accepted as true without proof end quote
so your life hinges on making high quality assumptions and
a lot of assumptions go unquestioned simply because on the
surface it just seems like they work and then questioning
these assumptions seems like well it's just some sort of
armchair theoretical philosophical pursuit that has nothing to do with
improving the material quality of my life but notice that
that itself is an assumption again that's a meta assumption
we'll get into that in a minute now you might
say okay leo so let me sort of swing the
pendulum in the opposite direction like i was making a
lot of assumptions in early in my life and now
i'm gonna i'm gonna swing the opposite way i'm gonna
be very very rigorous and make no assumptions at all
and that will be how we solve this problem right
well if you do that you'll be dead because you'll
be stuck in paralysis see proof is a luxury that
you don't have because you're an existential bind to survive
survival cannot sit around waiting for proof if you're walking
through the forest and you hear some growling loud animal
noises coming from the bushes near you do you have
time to stand there and say well that sounds like
it might be a grizzly bear but you know i
don't see it yet so that that's just an assumption
it's a grizzly bear maybe it's just uh you know
maybe some sort of innocent animal and uh and why
don't i why don't i get the proof i'm not
going to act on this information i'm just i'm going
to wait for the proof well if you stand there
and wait for the proof then the proof might be
the grizzly bear uh cracking your skull open with its
jaws that might be the proof and then it's too
late see the reason that i often poke fun at
and demean overly rational people as idiots is because in
a sense they are idiots because what they fail to
realize that survival trumps truth survival trumps rationality in fact
survival has completely co-opted your reasoning process because if it
didn't you'd be dead and you'd be very careful to
distinguish between truth and rationality as it is co-opted for
the purposes of your survival these are not the same
thing at all and overly rational people tend to forget
this distinction and therefore they can seem like they're very
logical and rational people but there's a deep deep cognitive
dissonance going on there because on the one hand they
are very rational but on the other hand in practice
what runs their life is their emotions the majority of
the decisions that you make in your life that drive
who you marry who you have sex with how you
interact with your children what kind of career you get
into what kind of food you eat and things like
this very practical stuff this is not done through logic
this is not done through proof this is not done
through science any kind of scientific rigorous method this is
mostly driven by your emotional system because your emotional system
is the primary system it's faster than the rational system
when the grizzly bear is growling at you through the
bushes it's not your logic that saves you it's your
emotional system you get a shot of adrenaline you feel
fear you're terrified your body is shaking the hair on
the back of your neck stands up and you're running
milliseconds you know you're jumping milliseconds after hearing that growl
you're already reacting and ready to run you can't react
that quickly through logic and through reason if you're gonna
sit there and rationalize and look for proofs and trying
to be all scientific about this the grizzly bear is
going to eat you so please understand the the seriousness
of what we're talking about here we're not talking about
philosophy we're talking about how you survive every single day
this is one of my biggest criticisms of academic philosophy
is that when philosophy is done academically in universities it's
so detached from survival concerns that it becomes uh really
delusional because there's there's a sort of fantasy that we
can sit in our armchair and and just philosophize about
what is the nature of the universe and where did
it all come from and what is god and what
is love and we can we can do this sort
of stuff but you can't get answers to those questions
from an armchair and most philosophers don't understand this and
in fact one of the appeals of philosophy for very
intellectual people is that it allows you to disconnect yourself
from mundane everyday survival concerns it allows you to sit
in that armchair and to just kind of speculate in
the abstract about various kinds of highfalutin questions and thinking
that you can arrive at the answers there's a double
trap here the double trap is that many scientifically people
scientifically minded people will say well yeah leo that's all
metaphysical stuff and that's why we don't like philosophy as
scientists as hard no scientists we don't like philosophy because
it's all just a bunch of abstractions and who really
knows it's it's it's uh it's not empirical and you
can just do a lot of [ __ ] basically
and come up with all sorts of conclusions and and
we don't like that we want something more practical and
more grounded so that's sort of the scientific perspective um
that's a trap actually because see there you're assuming that
the answers can't be reached that there are no actual
answers there are answers the problem is that you can't
reach the answers by sitting in an armchair you have
to actually put your own survival on the line to
answer some of these deep questions and so the fundamental
problem is that people go into philosophy or into spirituality
thinking that oh well leo's talking about stuff like love
and god sometimes and about spirit and about consciousness these
all sound like kind of like interesting cool abstract concepts
i kind of like how it all you know comes
together and it makes sense to me like yeah that's
all like interesting it's all just purely conceptual for you
and then you actually maybe try a psychedelic or you
go to do a 10-day meditation retreat you actually do
some serious spiritual work or some serious deep contemplation and
then maybe you discover you know some sort of truth
like self equals other or oneness or infinite love or
god or whatever you actually come face to face with
it experientially and then and then you're like holy [
__ ] my entire life is threatened by this exactly
that's why that's why these things that i talk about
are not generally talked about within academic philosophy because the
whole point of academic philosophy is that the ego has
sort of compartmentalized all the philosophy all the theory away
from one's actual survival and once you've made that partition
you're never gonna really reach the truth because the truth
must require you to face your own death for very
profound reasons because death isn't true for that go see
my episode what is death i will get into that
here so basically it's assumptions that get you into epistemic
trouble and it's not so obvious how we get ourselves
out of this trouble because you're damned if you do
and you're damned if you don't make assumptions you can't
really navigate life without making assumptions and yet by making
assumptions you open yourself up to a lot of self-deception
so fundamentally really try to ask yourself this question fundamentally
why are assumptions necessary think about that contemplate that here's
my answer because reality is infinite and yet your mind
your human mind is finite and so basically you need
to make assumptions because you're not omniscient and because you
have a bias towards survival if you were omniscient or
you didn't care about survival you would need to make
assumptions and by the way that is possible it is
both possible for you to be omniscient it's also possible
for you to not care about survival but understand what
that means that that's a very radical thing don't take
those two possibilities lightly uh if you became completely omniscient
your life would be over just understand that there would
be no more there would be nothing left for you
to care about or just to try to survive right
because you would be so conscious that the idea of
death itself would be laughable to you you would be
too conscious to believe that death is real and um
and if you didn't care about survival then you'd be
dead and then you couldn't be sitting here um i
mean what i mean by that is just let me
be clear um because i just said that the death
doesn't exist now i'm saying that you'd be dead leo
how do you reconcile that what i mean by you'd
be dead is that this human body would be would
expire and i mean the ultimate you never dies but
the human body would be dead this experience of life
this dream that you're in right now would be would
be over so um then you couldn't be sitting here
like a human trying to figure out your life because
there would not be a human life there anymore but
anyways i don't want to get too deeply into that
i've covered those issues elsewhere that's some very deep spiritual
truths there um let's get back to the more ordinary
stuff so notice that you actually you can't do science
physics or mathematics without assumptions impossible try to ask yourself
why why are assumptions so fundamental to science of course
you should also ask and deeply contemplate what are the
assumptions of science that's one of the most important questions
that if you're serious about science or you fancy yourself
a scientist you can spend the next 20 years contemplating
every single day the question what are the assumptions of
science or what are the assumptions of your specific field
of science if you're a biologist if you're a chemist
if you're a physicist if you're a whatever an economist
or something or a psychologist ask yourself like what are
the assumptions of psychology what are the assumptions of my
field what are the assumptions of my subfield what is
what do all of my colleagues assume and keep questioning
that and questioning that deeper and deeper and deeper and
if you want to do the most groundbreaking scientific research
this is what this is what you need to do
this is how you win nobel prizes i want you
to actually not just listen to me talking about this
conceptually but i want you to actually try to experiment
a little bit with how assumptions work in your psyche
try to make sense of anything in reality without using
assumptions and see if that's possible try it like try
to start a business without making any assumptions try to
do history without making any assumptions try to go on
a date or to do a romantic relationship with any
assumptions about your partner see if you can do that
see how far you can get actually do it try
living your ordinary life without assumptions try going to the
grocery store without assumptions try ordering food at the restaurant
without assumptions try buying a car without assumptions see how
far you can get and as you're doing that be
mindful introspective see my episode developing introspection use that introspection
self-reflection capacity to notice what kind of assumptions you are
making in these situations and why you're making those assumptions
and what would happen if you weren't making those assumptions
how would that affect your ability to survive in that
situation for example you're gonna go buy a used car
at the used car dealership in your town okay well
you're going in there what kind of assumptions are you
making about the dealership the car the salesperson and what
would happen if you didn't make those assumptions would you
buy a better car or a worse car would you
gain money or would you lose money would you be
happier or would you increase your suffering try it and
see see what happens see how far you can get
start with little things right i don't want you to
lose a bunch of money buying a used car i
mean try it with little things and just see um
see what comes up for you it's like an experiment
and this is really how you do philosophy you don't
just sit in an armchair you have to actually like
do it in your everyday life connect your philosophy with
your survival that's when things get really interesting most people
don't realize how deep assumptions go good epistemology metaphysics philosophy
science and spirituality is all about questioning and unearthing hidden
assumptions these assumptions are usually part of a sort of
a uh epistemic background that colors and informs and is
the context of your thinking about any situation and this
this epistemic background comes from your culture and the society
that you grew up in you pick it up through
osmosis so to speak so the key takeaway from this
episode just very if you want to boil it down
to something very practical is identify and question all assumptions
ruthlessly in whatever situation you're in whatever you're doing this
is the one key towards reaching the truth question all
assumptions but see it's easy for me to say that
and you might say well yeah duh of course that
sounds so obvious it is obvious the problem is that
you're not doing it and the problem is that it's
difficult to teach people how to actually question and unearth
these hidden assumptions it's difficult to unearth our assumptions because
they're largely unconscious implicit hidden and unspoken and because questioning
them oftentimes is emotionally disturbing because we've built our survival
and our life like a house of cards on a
foundation of bad assumptions but they were useful and they
were practical and they were utilitarian so we just sort
of ignored the fact that they're not really true and
we ignored the fact that we didn't really question them
very deeply because they just sort of worked and that's
all we cared about and so now to go back
and start to question assumptions that you made 10 20
30 40 50 years ago at the formation of your
early psyche when you were a child or a teenager
or a young adult to question those things this is
deeply emotionally disturbing and it's not just disturbing for emotional
people it's disturbing for rational people it's disturbing for scientists
for mathematicians for physicists who have built their careers on
various kinds of assumptions and these assumptions sometimes are so
simple and they are so obviously wrong and so obviously
idiotic that it can almost feel like you know you
feel embarrassed to even admit that you subscribed to this
assumption and were unable to notice this assumption for 30
or 40 years of your life and that you actually
built an entire career upon it like maybe you became
a doctor based upon the assumption that one the health
care system actually improves the health of of people and
actually cares about their health and two that as a
doctor you would have a sort of a prestige and
success and material wealth that would make you happy maybe
those were two assumptions that you assumed when you decided
when you were in your let's say uh late teen
age years in high school that you're gonna become a
doctor and then you worked really hard for the next
10 years and you became a doctor and now you're
really invested in it you got a bunch of student
loans so you got to pay off you know 100
000 of student loans or even more um and but
those two assumptions those are two false assumptions it might
take you 20 30 years to realize that those two
assumptions are false and then when you do um that's
gonna be that's gonna sting you emotionally see that's not
that's not just a philosophical that's not a philosophical matter
this is gonna threaten your whole career it's gonna maybe
threaten your marriage it's gonna threaten your financial situation it's
gonna leave you in a existential funk or crisis you're
not gonna know what what career should you take and
how will you transition to that new career you gotta
get retrained re-educated how are you going to pay off
your loan like you see so the majority of doctors
who operate let's say on these two assumptions i'm not
saying all doctors do i mean i'm sure some doctors
love what they do that's just one example um but
if you became a doctor based on these two false
assumptions are you going to be incentivized to really deeply
introspect and become aware of these two assumptions because see
these two assumptions are rather implicit if you don't sit
down and and deliberately question them you'll probably never realize
they were assumptions and your culture and your society will
mislead you and gaslight you because your culture tells you
oh being a doctor so prestigious maybe for example when
you're you know socializing and you tell women that you're
a doctor if you're a man maybe they start to
like you know get more attracted to you because oh
you're a doctor that's you know that's much better than
dating some guy who works at starbucks and so maybe
you even get sex from that so are you gonna
are you as long as you're getting nice sex um
from this you know prestige that you have are you
gonna are you gonna question these assumptions no of course
not you have too much to lose same so a
lot of times there are these kind of perverse incentives
and that's because precisely because we're using these various kinds
of false assumptions to construct a life and the life
that we're constructing is a house of cards and a
lot of times what we're doing is that we're collectively
we're not just doing this individually we're doing it collectively
see when you become a doctor you don't just become
a doctor by yourself you're doing it as part of
a culture your culture puts certain value and prestige and
status on the fact that you're a doctor you get
a certain title um you get a certain credential and
you get certain privileges and people look up to you
and maybe more people have sex with you and they
give you more money and blah blah blah blah you
can charge more per hour and um and see all
these are these create a sort of perverse incentive when
you have all these goodies that you get from that
you stop caring about the truth you forget about the
fact that you've built a house of cards and that
your house of cards your whole life is very fragile
and then you actually become sort of defensive about it
too and then what can happen is that you actually
you can start to feel bad about your life but
then you won't even understand where your bad feelings are
coming from for example you might be a doctor a
successful doctor but you're depressed why are you depressed well
you're depressed because let's say i mean there's many reasons
you could be depressed but in this case for the
purpose of this example one reason might be that you
wanted to become a doctor originally because you really wanted
to help people but then when you became a doctor
you realize that the healthcare industry is not so much
about helping people it's more about charging people and um
it's not about really looking out for their holistic well-being
it's about fixing some very narrow problem that they have
and then they can be sick in many other ways
and like helping the richest rather than helping the ones
who need it the most and maybe that doesn't sit
well with you because you just assumed that by becoming
a doctor you would be helping the ones who need
it the most and you would actually be looking out
for their overall health and well-being and then you discover
that's not the case within much of the healthcare industry
in the west um and then that might make you
depressed but then see you might be depressed but then
you won't even be honest with yourself about where the
depression is coming from you might miss attribute it to
something else because to properly understand its source you would
have to look at these assumptions and then admit that
you've been building this house of cards on a false
foundation and maybe you're depressed because of the second assumption
you believe that having the status and the and the
material wealth that that being a doctor would give you
that this would make you happy and fulfilled in life
but you realize that that's not how happiness works so
you had you had a false assumption about human psychology
and about happiness really and that's very difficult to admit
because again you might be depressed and you might not
know well why am i depressed i have a house
i have a nice wife i got children i have
all the material good i a fast sports car and
i'm still not happy we'll see you have to go
back like 30 years into your past to realize oh
i made a bad assumption about how human psychology and
happiness works and and the role that material possessions fit
play into that but then why did i spend 30
years working so hard to acquire all these material things
if they don't make me happy right you see leads
to an existential crisis then you have to re-evaluate your
whole like decision-making paradigm and your whole value structure and
then you have to ask yourself well so then how
do i become happy and then you might say well
maybe i need to go meditate maybe i need to
quit work and go live in a cave or something
for a year and it's like well but if i
do that then i'm going to lose my wife i'm
going to lose my house i'm going to lose my
my sports car and then what you see these are
the sort of traps we get ourselves into so anyways
back to science science is full of unquestioned metaphysical and
epistemic assumptions i've talked about this many times before as
i've railed against science um the limits of science so
unearthing these assumptions is crucial for good science and yet
most scientists poo poo epistemology and metaphysics and philosophy so
they're never able to question their assumptions deeply enough and
this creates bad science this creates paradigm lock see my
older episode called um how paradigms work i believe that's
what it's called where i talk about paradigm log see
fundamentally the the trouble here is that questioning assumptions requires
selflessness of course why well if you watched my previous
content you should know that there's deep there's a deep
relationship between selflessness and truth because the truth is that
there is no self and so one of the deepest
assumptions you have metaphysical assumptions is that you assume that
there is a self and you don't want to question
that assumption that assumption turned out to be false and
that's the whole point of spirituality is to question that
one uh mother of all assumptions so the mother the
mother of all fuck-ups is assuming that there's a there's
there's a fight itself so also you know we're tying
a lot of episodes together here a lot of concepts
together that i've talked about previously we're going to talk
about now self bias see my episodes on self bias
so self bias and attachment will prevent you from questioning
the deepest and most important assumptions why because your finite
sense of self the human biographical self that you have
is made up of out of a bunch of very
deep metaphysical assumptions that if they are questioned the self
will unravel and collapse your your your ego mind will
collapse and all the stuff that you're attached to all
of that will collapse it will be very threatening to
you and it'll feel like your whole life has imploded
and so most people spend their lives avoiding actively avoiding
this kind of self-reflection to to prevent the collapse of
their finite sense of self and so in a sense
they're they're actively running around avoiding spirituality that's the that's
the trick it's not that they're not doing spirituality they're
they're actively anti-spiritual so i recognize the importance of questioning
assumptions really early in my life when i was like
age 15 and i started doing philosophy i just saw
that a lot of science a lot of religion was
filled with with assumptions and i didn't see that these
assumptions were grounded or well justified in anything and this
made me very suspicious first of religion and then of
science see it's it's much easier to see the false
assumptions of religion it's harder to see the assumptions of
science that takes more intelligence that takes a deeper level
of contemplation and it takes a real um sort of
a lack of self-bias a real neutrality because culture imprints
you with the idea that science is neutral and objective
but that itself is just an assumption and so basically
all of my epistemic work and i think the power
of my teachings stems ultimately from the fact that i
was very serious early on in my life about questioning
assumptions i took that seriously i saw it as important
i didn't take it for granted and so i want
to impart that attitude upon you in this episode so
that you don't take it for granted and then you
can get the the sort of fruits of decades of
questioning assumptions in your life that's basically what the last
few decades of my life have been and i see
that for most people it isn't like that and i
can see that they suffer as a result of that
they're not able to get to that deep level of
understanding that i know is possible from having questioned assumptions
for for a few decades and the earlier you begin
this process the better because when your mind is still
young it's more fluid and flexible once your mind gets
older it gets more rigid and those assumptions get so
deeply baked into your mind that they can become virtually
impossible to see all right so here are some domains
within which you should start to question assumptions science atheism
rationality relationships dating family socializing and attraction politics economics investing
health and nutrition and fitness about yourself your self-image your
self-beliefs your victim mindset all the ways you think of
yourself there are a lot of assumptions you have about
yourself that create a lot of suffering for you there
for example you might assume that you're not an attractive
person you might assume that you're too short you might
assume that you're too shy you might assume you have
bad genetics you might assume that you're not good at
business you might assume that you're not an artistic person
you're not a disciplined person things like this you've got
to be really careful with those uh another domain is
philosophy within philosophy you got a question all assumptions basically
any philosopher that you read as you're reading that philosopher
you should just be like keeping a mental list of
every assumption that this philosopher makes about reality and you'll
quickly be able to deconstruct uh any philosophical system in
this way and then and then you don't get trapped
into it you see the way you get trapped in
some kind of worldview or ideology or paradigm or philosophy
or even into science is by just swallowing it wholesale
and not questioning its assumptions and and really you're not
seeing its assumptions that's the problem you're not conscious of
the assumptions so whether it's christianity or hinduism or buddhism
or existentialism or nihilism or materialism or idealism they all
have assumptions you need to become conscious of what those
assumptions are science also has many assumptions as we've said
within religion spirituality and the new age there are many
assumptions too that you have to question so not just
organized religion yeah of course there's a lot of assumptions
in catholicism that you got a question or an islam
but also there's a lot of sort of new agey
cult-like sort of woo spiritual teachings these days that you
could find online even non-dual teachings and teachers they make
assumptions too you got to question those because again see
people people sort of like bounce from one thing to
another thing they're sort of reactive it's like well orthodox
religion is full of assumptions and [ __ ] and
then you might even say well even materialist science is
full of assumptions and [ __ ] and then you
might say even the new age is full of assumptions
and [ __ ] but then non-duality ah leo i've
discovered non-duality and and advaita and there now there's no
assumptions no there's many assumptions there there are many many
many many assumptions that your favorite non-dual teachers make so
be careful you have to question those uh the the
other domain is business career and uh and when it
comes to money a lot of assumptions go into that
and in the personal development field in the self-help field
there's also a lot of assumptions that are made there's
also cultural assumptions so there's assumptions that you personally make
in your life and then there's assumptions that your culture
feeds you this is like the collective ego go see
my episode about about collective ego it's one of my
best episodes so um assumptions are baked into your culture
and absorbed by osmosis imprinting indoctrination i've talked about that
before whatever your tribe or group or culture assumes and
takes for granted you will tend to assume it and
take it for granted too you will take it as
reality and it's very difficult to question that which you
hold as physical reality because part of your notion of
physical reality is that it's real and therefore it can't
be questioned it can't be changed but that begs the
question because how do you know it's real to begin
with so you assumed it was real you assumed it
was physical but what if it isn't this is the
trap that many materials fall into so there are many
cultural assumptions that you adopt when it comes to domains
like religion business science philosophy art morality sexuality nutrition relationships
many of the things you believe about these different domains
are assumptions that you never questioned that you absorbed from
your culture so now we're going to start to move
into a list i'm going to give you a large
list of various kinds of assumptions mundane assumptions metaphysical assumptions
and so forth that you should be thinking about this
will just start to get your mind jogging in the
right direction i will point out assumptions that you hold
which you should question uh of course the hard part
is just seeing the assumption and then articulating the assumption
that requires some contemplative work you have to figure out
how to articulate it the mind is very sneaky and
it can take you years just to articulate a simple
assumption that you hold that you held your whole life
yet the beauty of assumptions that they tend to be
fairly simple one statement sorry one line statements and so
when you discover it and articulate it as a single
sentence short statement it can be very clear and powerful
and then you can once you identify the assumption then
you can sort of step outside of the assumption and
you're no longer swimming in it so to speak like
a fish in water not seeing the water so for
example here's here's some assumptions to get us rolling uh
the twisting of a door knob will open the door
that's an assumption you have and notice sometimes that assumption
is subverted sometimes you will twist a doorknob and the
door won't open and you'll be puzzled and surprised and
that's exactly what happens when one of your assumptions is
subverted is that you get surprised you get a little
mind [ __ ] moment now how big the mind
[ __ ] is it can be small if it's
something trivial and mundane like a doorknob or it can
be something very significant and profound which we'll get to
later in this list when it's something deep and metaphysical
like you know the idea that there is no self
no finite self for example also like the assumption that
the clock that you're looking at is showing the correct
time you assume that when you look at a clock
the assumption that the person you're texting is still alive
why would you text somebody unless you assumed they were
alive but maybe they died since the last time you
texted you don't know you assumed they didn't but imagine
imagine that you're texting your friend and then your your
friend is responding and then and then your friend stops
responding for a few days and you start to wonder
like what happened did i say something wrong is he
mad at me is he busy and then a week
passes and now you're gonna start to get worried and
then you get a phone call telling you that your
friend is dead you're gonna be very surprised aren't you
because you were assuming that he's alive and do you
see in this example how problematic it would be if
you kept living your life under the assumption that he's
alive when he's actually dead can you see can you
see the problem there because i feel like there's a
tendency for people to say well leo assumptions they're what's
the big deal about assumptions but notice imagine that you
assumed your friend was alive yet he was dead for
an entire year and you weren't informed about it and
you kept living your life and making plans as though
your friend is alive you kept planning vacations together and
you kept thinking about him and talking to him in
your head and all this sorts of stuff you see
so there is a cost to pay when your mental
models of reality diverge more and more from truth how
about the assumption that the person that you're talking to
understood your communication this is a very practical one usually
when we're speaking to somebody we assume they understood us
but a lot of times what they understood is different
than what we were trying to get them to understand
and we only find this out much much much much
later at great cost for example maybe i'm hiring an
employee so you know we do an interview i communicate
certain job requirements and expectations that i have for him
working for me and then it seems like he understands
and that we're on the same page you know you
got to show up on time here are your hours
your shop you're coming nine to five five days a
week monday through friday and all these other sorts of
standard things and it seems like we understood each other
you're going to be getting your paycheck you know every
two weeks and blah blah blah but then you know
a month passes or so and then the employee does
something horrible that hurts my business and then i ask
him you know why'd you do that and then we
find out that oh he didn't understand some some principle
a rule that i said that he was supposed to
be following he didn't understand it correctly i thought he
understood it but he didn't understand it and now it
comes back to bite me in the ass hurts my
business see uh clear communication is a huge topic i'm
gonna do a whole series on conscious communication because it's
very important um that's for another another day um here's
an assumption that the person you're dealing with is honest
usually you assume that but that's not always the case
and that can lead to huge huge practical consequences can
destroy your entire life if you make this mistake with
the wrong person in the wrong situation the assumption that
you took your wallet with you when you left the
house the assumption that you don't have cancer right now
the assumption that the product you purchased isn't defective the
assumption that things will go according to plan the assumption
that the future will be like the past that the
sun will rise tomorrow that winter will end the assumption
that there won't be a mass shooting at your child's
school the assumption when you get on a plane that
your plane won't crash the assumption that whatever you're investing
in will pay off the assumption that your business plan
will work out the assumption that you'll be able to
get clients through this method here the assumption that you
will hate this food that you've never tried before like
maybe you've never eaten pig intestines because you assume you
would hate it but is that true the assumption that
you will hate some activity maybe you've never tried anal
sex you've never tried let's say anal sex because you
assume you wouldn't enjoy it but what if you would
the assumption that the news you read is accurate and
doesn't withhold certain information or isn't biased or distorted the
assumption that the waiter didn't spit in your food the
assumption that you're going to close the deal or the
sale that's a huge one when i was in a
different line of work in a different business that i
used to run i had an online business before actualize.org
it involved more sales and sort of deals and partnerships
that i you know did with with big clients and
companies and um and in those cases a lot of
times you know i would expect a business deal to
go through and then it doesn't go through and it
can be very disappointing when that happens or the deal
you know there's some snag in the deal there's some
assumption that i made about the deal but then like
the price or the terms of the time frame and
then it turns out those assumptions were wrong and that
can really hurt you in business so part of becoming
good at business for example is getting really good and
clear about the communications and the assumptions that go into
all the business deals all the marketing strategies all the
product development plans that sort of stuff if you're bad
at that you're going to be bad at business and
you're going to go bankrupt real quick the assumptions that
your parents are your actual biological parents the assumption that
you're going to live beyond tomorrow a lot of people
take that for granted um see no notice notice that
most the time you go through life just expecting tomorrow
to be to be there for you but what if
you knew that tomorrow wasn't going to be there how
would that change your life the assumption that eating fat
makes you fat what if eating sugar makes you more
fat than eating fat makes you fat that's a little
counterintuitive there the assumption that this person you're sleeping with
is not going to give you an std the assumption
that your pregnancy will be a single baby and not
twins or triplets and therefore you're gonna have twice the
cost imagine you plan for a baby and you're like
okay you know i've put all my finances together i
have enough for for you know for this baby that
we're gonna have and then you have a triplets now
you have three babies you need three times the money
for the clothes for the food for the bedrooms for
them for college that's a rather rude awakening there the
assumption that your insurance will cover your loss you assume
that when you total your car or there's a fire
in your house that your insurance will cover it but
what if there's some sort of you know niggly legal
detail in the contract that allows the insurance company not
to pay you the assumption that the cashier charged you
accurately when you're buying your groceries or whatever the assumption
that the police will treat you fairly the assumption that
that the things your professors taught you in university were
true the assumption that the history you learned in school
was accurate the assumption that the things you're reading in
this book that you're reading right now are true the
assumption that x will make you happy whatever that x
is it could be money it could be a car
it could be a house it could be sex it
could be drugs the assumption that your appointment will show
up on time the assumption that you're too short or
too ugly as a guy to attract a hot girl
a lot of guys hold this assumption also these sorts
of guys tend to hold the assumption that girls are
[ __ ] who will cheat on you uh how
about this one this one's also a painful one the
assumption that if a girl gives you her phone number
when you flirt with her after you flip over there
that she will respond to your texts and actually want
to go on a date with you oh man if
you hold this assumption you're in for a rude awakening
uh the assumption that rich and successful people are happy
the assumption that people are equal the assumption that all
people want democracy the assumption that corruption is bad see
people don't assume that corruption is bad but for the
people who are corrupt corruption is not bad for them
corruption is good that's why corruption exists if corruption was
universally bad there would be no corruption how about the
assumption that climate change is a bad thing again if
climate change was a universal bad thing it would not
exist or let's say pollution for example um the reason
pollution exists is because it's a good thing for many
people many people profit off of pollution in fact you
profit off pollution because you know your car pollutes if
you have a car and uh but you you you
don't care you still drive your car even though it
pollutes why because it benefits you for you literally that
pollution is a good thing if if pollution was bad
for you you would stop driving your car but you
don't the assumption that owning a gun will make you
safer actually the statistics show that if you have a
gun you're in more danger than if you don't because
of the high likelihood of a misfire or using that
gun for suicide or some children getting their hands on
that gun how about the assumption that the the food
you eat is healthy you think it's healthy but is
it really healthy how would you know the assumption that
whatever ex scientific study is accurate a lot of times
you read cnn or some sort of mainstream news site
and they oftentimes publish you know some new trendy study
that came out you know some new studies shows you
that avocados are good for your heart some new study
shows you that coffee is causes cancer some new study
shows that drinking glass of wine per day will you
know improve your chances of not getting all timers or
whatever um and you just read these studies and you
kind of just take them at face value but then
a lot of times these studies are contradicted by future
studies five years later and usually you just assume that
these studies are true actually like some crazy number like
40 or even 50 percent of all scientific studies that
are that are published they've actually done sort of meta
meta meta studies on the studies going back in time
and they discovered like 40 or 50 of those studies
um are eventually invalidated and they can't be replicated which
means it's [ __ ] science up to 50 percent
think about that and you put so much stock into
science the assumption that your doctor knows what he's talking
about when he's giving you advice i've had a lot
of doctors give me horrible advice just awful advice but
if you're naive you can go into a doctor and
just think that your doctor knows everything a lot of
times you can you can learn more about your condition
or your disease or your a element just by doing
five hours of research online you can find out more
accurate information than you will by paying 200 to go
see a doctor the assumption that christ was a real
person see if you're a christian it never even occurs
to you to question that assumption you just assume it
but you don't really know that jesus was a real
person and moreover you don't want to seriously question that
assumption you don't even want to acknowledge that it's an
assumption because as soon as you acknowledge that christ being
a real person is just an assumption as soon as
you admit that i mean this undermines the entire house
of cards uh house of cards of of what you
know we would call christianity that might be the foundation
of your whole life and so your mind will rationalize
to you like oh well no i can't admit that
jesus christ was an assumption i can't admit that that
would be a sin to admit that you see so
the way that a paradigm log happens again go see
my episode about how paradigms work the way paradigm lock
happens is that your world view has a mechanism in
there that demonizes the questioning of the worldview right so
in the christian worldview it's like a hermetically sealed bubble
it maintains its integrity and it survives in the world
you survive uh by demonizing calling out the assumptions of
the worldview by the way science does this too in
in its own way so watch out you know uh
a christian cannot admit that christ might be an assumption
well it's not that it might be it is an
assumption the fact that christ was a real person is
an assumption because you have no direct experience of christ
so it is an assumption you hold that this was
a real person um and just to admit that to
yourself for most christians that's beyond the pale to them
that they would consider that a sin you're supposed to
have faith but it's not true the truth is that
it's an assumption now maybe he was a real person
but you are assuming that the assumption that your food
isn't poisonous you make that assumption every single time you
eat and notice you don't even think about it so
here's the real trick and devil of the assumption game
is that these assumptions are so buried think about when
you sit down to eat a meal how many assumptions
are buried that you never even think about that never
even cross your mind until just now i'm bringing it
up to you like you're assuming nobody's spat in your
food you're assuming there's no salmonella in your food you're
assuming there's no poison in your food you're assuming your
food is cooked properly you're assuming that this food is
healthy for you like there's probably a thousand assumptions that
go into just eating a single plate of food and
if you sat there questioning all these assumptions you would
starve to death that's my point and yet one of
these assumptions if you get it wrong it can kill
you you see how tricky this is your assumption that
your boyfriend or girlfriend isn't cheating on you the assumption
that male and female are biological objective facts your assumption
that your body is your property a lot of libertarians
make this assumption your assumption that you have certain inalienable
rights this is some [ __ ] that was invented
in the us constitution there's no such thing as inalienable
rights human rights are a complete fiction there's no such
thing as human rights but people just assume it again
because you know we're taught in school that if you're
an american that you have the constitution guarantees you certain
inalienable rights and blah blah blah i mean it's just
pure [ __ ] fantasy it's just an assumption uh
your assumption that your religion is true notice that that's
a meta assumption you assume that um or conversely if
you're an atheist your assumption that all religion is [
__ ] in superstition that's also just an assumption you
hold and it's it's also not true uh your assumption
that ufos are a hoax the assumption that you are
human and yes that is an assumption you actually assume
that you're human your assumption that you were born and
that you will die yes those are assumptions your assumption
that the world existed before you were born yes that
is an assumption your assumption that other people exist or
have subjective experience outside of you yes that's an assumption
too the assumption that there's anything outside of consciousness or
perception that's an assumption the assumption of object permanence when
you're not looking at the moon yet you assume the
moon exists that's an assumption the assumption that psychedelics are
a hallucination in the brain that's an assumption the assumption
that you can handle a double dose of psychedelic that
one can get you in a lot of trouble the
assumption that psychedelics will affect your friend in the same
way they affect you watch out for that one a
lot of people get themselves or their friends in trouble
this in this way like you know well leo i
took two tabs of lsd and for me it was
fine i i was fine and then i gave my
friend two tabs of lsd two because we were tripping
together and he had a complete freak out and meltdown
yeah because you assumed that your friend has the same
tolerance level as you and it turns out that your
friend is twice as sensitive as you so in effect
what you thought were two tabs turned out to be
four tabs for him oops the assumption that the mind
or consciousness is produced by the brain this is a
really problematic assumption for scientists and materialists and neuroscientists the
assumption that nothing can move faster than the speed of
light the assumption that time and space are absolute the
assumption that philosophy is a waste of time the assumption
that iq measures intelligence accurately the assumption that expertx whatever
the expert name is expert's name is is correct about
something you know a lot of times we look up
to experts on tv on youtube or public speakers we
just assume that they're experts and that they know the
answer some doctor some lawyer some military person some government
person we assume that they're an expert therefore they must
be correct but experts are all often wrong the assumption
that you only have one life that's an assumption the
assumption that evil exists the assumption that slavery is objectively
wrong that's an assumption the assumption that terrorists are acting
from bad intentions that's an assumption you make the assumption
that physical reality is not a dream that's something you
assume most people do at least the assumption that pain
and suffering prove that something is real it shocks me
on this point how gullible people are a lot of
times people try to refute certain arguments that i make
by saying that oh leo but you know if we
cut off your hand or we we shoot you in
the leg and you know you're going to experience suffering
and pain and then all of your philosophy will fly
out the window and it will get disproven love and
god and all the truth it'll all get disproven no
nothing is disproven with pain and suffering pain and suffering
does not prove the reality of absolutely anything in a
dream you can experience extreme pain and suffering that doesn't
make the dream real you're just assuming that the assumption
that truth can be proven and validated and falsified this
is a silly assumption that a lot of scientific people
make uh scientifically-minded people make the assumption that the paranormal
is uh subject to scientific method see scientists just assume
that oh well if it's paranormal i can use a
scientific method on it and prove it no why would
you assume that i mean maybe that maybe you could
for certain paranormal things but for other paranormal things maybe
you can't do that the assumption that university or academia
is interested in truth-seeking and that that is what it's
about see you just to assume that if you're going
to university and being an academic that well i'm a
truth seeker no you're not that's not primarily what university
is about the assumption that a phd means someone is
smart and knows the truth no you can have five
phds and still not know the truth the assumption that
if the truth were known it could be taught to
you it could be communicated to you but what if
truth is such a thing that it can't be communicated
why are you assuming that it could the assumption that
science is the best epistemic method a lot of people
make this assumption but notice that's just an assumption the
assumption that science is willing to correct itself a lot
of people make this assumption but oftentimes science is not
willing to correct itself science can be very stubborn in
maintaining its dogmas and errors the assumption that everything real
and true can be proven with science again this is
a huge assumption of science which isn't true the assumption
that everything real and true is logical and rational this
is another one that we've talked about in the past
it's not true the assumption that science is true because
it works the assumption that direct experience to absolute truth
is impossible the assumption that no one has answered the
deepest existential questions of life because they can't be answered
for example a lot of people assume that it's impossible
to answer definitively and absolutely the question of why is
there something rather than nothing why does the universe exist
you can absolutely answer this question but most people assume
you can't the assumption that a scientific method exists there's
no such thing as a scientific method that never was
this is just a myth of culture the assumption that
reality is mathematical the assumption that reality is run by
cause and effect the assumption that reality is a simulation
the assumption that there is a veil of perception which
means that you assume that there's there's a there's some
sort of veil between the perceptions you have and the
truth most scientists make this mistake this assumption the assumption
that rocks don't have consciousness the assumption that there's a
difference between reality and fantasy the assumption that science is
superior to religion the assumption that reality is finite or
limited the assumption that love is just a human emotion
the assumption that god does not exist or the assumption
that god does exist you can make the assumption in
both directions on that one the assumption that god exists
but is other than you is not you that's an
assumption that most religious people make uh the assumption that
the bible of the quran is true or false you
could assume both in both directions and you'd be wrong
uh the assumption that your guru isn't misleading you a
lot of spiritual and new age people make this mistake
is it they just assumed that well i found my
guru and my guru can't mislead me oh boy you're
in for a rude awakening if you assume that the
assumption that an enlightened master can't sexually abuse you oh
boy watch out for that one especially you ladies watch
out for that one uh the assumption that an enlightened
master cannot be wrong again same situation the assumption that
meditation will get you to the highest levels of consciousness
and awakening a lot of spiritual people make that assumption
the assumption that meditation is equally effective for everybody that's
a that's a really problematic assumption that i see very
commonly in in non-dual circles in meditative circles the assumption
that solipsism can't can't be true the assumption that modern
man is more advanced than man was in the past
i mean mankind the assumption that people inhabit the same
reality like we just tend to assume that you know
i have a reality and you have your reality and
there's the same reality but what if my reality is
different than your reality the assumption that science and mathematics
are objective the assumption that there's a difference between mind
and body there's an assumption that any finite method can
capture reality all of reality the assumption that you've reached
the highest level of awakening watch out for that one
i've spoken many times about deeper levels of awakening and
the traps that come with getting stuck on the lower
levels and assuming that you're done when you're not the
assumption that there is some objective way that reality is
at all that's a very deep one the assumption that
academics understand more than mystics the assumption that reality must
be non-mystical the assumption that eventually science will demystify all
of reality but you see how would you know whether
science can demystify all of reality you're just begging the
question there you're assuming reality can be demystified in its
total you know ultimately in its totality because you're assuming
reality must be non-mystical but what if reality is mystical
then you can't demystify it the assumption that reality is
quantifiable this is a huge limitation of science is that
if you can't quantify they basically consider it unreal but
what if there are real things which can't be quantified
in fact what if most things in the universe can't
be quantified well that's a big problem for you mathematicians
and scientists um the assumption that scientific method applies to
consciousness what if it doesn't what if consciousness is prior
to scientific method after all scientific method is a part
of consciousness consciousness is not a part of scientific method
you got that backwards the assumption that reality cannot be
magic that's a big mind [ __ ] when you
discover that it is um the assumption that telepathy omniscience
angels are woo the assumption that all woo is false
what if some woo is true the assumption that your
ideas of good and bad are objective what if they're
not the assumption that there could be multiple realities as
in not one but two or three the assumption that
reality has a bottom level or scale to it like
a sort of a plank length what if reality goes
on forever what if you can zoom into it forever
zoom out of it forever or if it's infinite the
assumption that the religion is [ __ ] the new
age is [ __ ] ghosts are [ __ ]
those are assumptions you don't know that ghosts are [
__ ] you just assume that the assumption that the
miracles of jesus are just myths and exaggeration what if
they weren't what if they were real the assumption that
the whole can be understood by breaking it up into
parts this is a huge assumption within science this is
otherwise known as reductionism which is in opposition to holism
go see my episodes called understanding holistic thinking and part
one and part two and also hold ons water hold
ons that's a third episode the assumption that you interpreted
the data correctly like you're doing science you're gathering data
okay great but then you just assume that okay well
i gathered the data and everything is good right and
my scientific study shows this conclusion here yeah but that
conclusion only holds as long as you assume you interpreted
the data correctly and you gathered it correctly which is
dangerous to assume data can be difficult to gather and
it can be even more difficult to interpret it correctly
the assumption that data wasn't cherry-picked the assumption that you're
not self-deceived i mean this is one of the like
biggest meta assumptions that most people hold most people assume
that they're not self-deceived and yet most people are self-deceived
so of course if you were self-deceived you would precisely
assume that you weren't which is how you became self-deceived
in the first place a corollary related assumption to this
is assuming that what your mind is telling you is
truthful and accurate people just assume like your mind is
talking it's like a little you know gremlin in your
head talking talking talking talking and you just trust whatever
your mind says you know your mind might say like
oh i suck i'm ugly i'm bad with money i'm
bad with women i'm bad in relationships i'm i'm this
and i'm that and i'll never make it and i
and all this like you're my your mind a little
gremlin in your mind can be telling you all that
and you're just you're just being a fool and accepting
all of that is true that's a huge paradigm shift
when you realize that's just an assumption all right so
that's the list of assumptions i have for you you
should question all of these think about them very deeply
and of course continue building your own list what kind
of assumptions do you hold in your life and how
might they be holding you back and what prevents you
from questioning them deeper more deeply here are some practical
areas of application for assumptions because i really want to
drive home point the point to you of how practical
this episode is so for example in the area of
business and making hiring decisions when you're hiring an employee
it's very tempting to assume things about this person based
on their age their appearance their dress their style you
know you tend to judge a person by their initial
appearances by their resume by their application things like that
it's easy to make sort of assumptions about will this
person fit my company or my project or won't they
um and this can get you into a lot of
trouble so like one practical takeaway from this if you're
if you're doing business and you're hiring people just one
little shift you can make that will improve your business
is in the future when you're hiring people be much
more open-minded and very careful and kind of like cognizant
mindful or introspective about assumptions you make about people that
you're you know different candidates that you're potentially going to
hire and and then when you when you do hire
one of them uh be careful your assumptions about your
communications with them like a lot of times business problems
happen because you're not clearly communicating with your partner business
partner or employee or your boss or whatever and you
two have different ideas about like what we need to
do for this project like let's say we need to
we need to create an ad for our new ad
campaign okay but then my idea for the ad and
your idea for the ad are gonna be two different
ideas and we're gonna be kind of working against each
other and miscommunicating while assuming that we both are on
the same page right so it's good to double check
are we really on the same page and to kind
of do that a lot within business otherwise you're going
to waste a lot of time working in opposite directions
also with business there's a lot of assumptions that go
into sales marketing advertising a lot of times you will
let's say you're gonna consider spending five thousand dollars on
some ad campaign and you're assuming that well if i'm
gonna get a thousand clicks let's say i'm going to
get 100 000 impressions with a certain percentage conversion rate
i'm going to get x number of clicks those clicks
will turn into x number of sales from a conversion
rate then i'm going to you know those sales are
going to get me this much money and then from
that money i can then do in the next marketing
campaign right so you assume all these numbers and things
and then you get really like invested in that and
then you realize that none of those numbers actually are
accurate or let's say you're starting a business and you
have a business plan like let's say you're going to
be selling some product and then you have to wonder
like where are your clients going to come from where
is the where is the traffic going to come from
that is going to be buying your potential products and
you some well i can get those i can get
those customers from running this ad you know facebook ad
campaign and you assume that the facebook ad campaign will
get you the kind of customers that will buy your
product but that's not that's not a given you have
to test that assumption and you have to be clear
with yourself that that's just an assumption and then when
you when you are clear about that then you could
say okay so that's one avenue of marketing and getting
customers but maybe i need five more and then you
say well i could run a like a magazine ad
i can maybe do a sponsorship deal on some youtube
video with some creator i can advertise on the radio
i can do something else and so you need multiple
of these and all these are have certain assumptions baked
into them and then you have to test all of
them out and see what actually works this is really
how you succeed in business a lot of newbies they
get into business and they have like just one strategy
for how they're going to market or get customers and
then event and quickly they usually learn that it doesn't
work and then they they quit a lot of times
if you're doing big business deals like multi thousand six
figure or even seven figure business deals uh you're buying
a large house you're buying a car you're buying a
plane you know you're buying an entire business you know
there's a lot of assumptions that go into that you
have to be very very careful with these sorts of
big purchasing decisions how about in the area of investing
also very practical you have to be very careful about
the assumptions you make when you're investing in you know
right now people have been investing a lot in in
cryptocurrency it's sort of like a fad that's going on
now and i'm not saying not to invest in it
per se in fact full disclosure i do own some
cryptocurrency but what i see is that a lot of
people will will kind of jump on the bandwagon start
investing in stuff just assuming that it's going to keep
rising it's going to keep rising that's an assumption right
you're assuming that you know bitcoin is going to reach
100 000 in the next year you're assuming that you
don't know that right this is where you can really
get burned with investing of course not just cryptocurrencies but
with stocks and bonds like there's so many assumptions that
go into making investment decisions and a lot of times
you can get so um like rosy in your view
of like oh yeah i'm an investment company this is
going to keep rising and right you create this sort
of fantasy this assumed fantasy in your mind of how
your investment is going to rise after you invest in
it but you see that that's a very self-serving and
biased way of looking at things you overlook your mind
overlooks how things could crash how much money you could
lose see so people who jump into cryptocurrency they're they're
thinking about like how yeah if i invest five thousand
dollars and then the cryptocurrency you know increases by a
hundredfold then i'm going to become a billionaire a millionaire
overnight within a year and then i'm just going to
be able to retire and and do whatever i want
and travel around the world like yeah but that all
hinges on the idea that it it's going to keep
rising there's no guarantee of that you have to also
consider the opposite of that is what if it all
crashes because it's a house of cards that's also very
likely and you don't really know which is which so
when you have a more balanced perspective then you're going
to be more hesitant to just throw your money into
the thing and then you could save yourself a lot
of heartache i mean people people kill themselves because they
make horrible investments that end up completely devastating them financially
the next domain which is very practical for you guys
especially but also for girls when it comes to romance
when it comes to attraction dating and sexuality there are
a lot of assumptions that go into that especially because
the the domain of attractions and started forming relationships a
lot of implicit subtle stuff is happening below the level
of conscious awareness so for you guys that are that
are struggling and trying to attract girls you make a
lot of assumptions about for example what girls are attracted
to and what they aren't and a lot of these
are wrong you make a lot of assumptions about how
attractive you are you make a lot of assumptions about
you know which girl will like you and which girl
won't you might go to a bar you might see
a hot girl and you might want to talk to
her but then you make an assumption like ah but
that guy next to her is probably her boyfriend ah
but if you actually go and talk to her and
ask her hey who's this guy next to you she'll
say oh this is my gay friend you see but
you assumed it was her boyfriend and then you talk
to her some more and she would say oh i'm
single and i like you but you assumed that she
wouldn't like you because you don't like how you look
or you think you're too short or whatever you see
your mind will play huge tricks on you in this
in this domain um uh and that's just the tip
of the iceberg i mean there's so many assumptions that
go into dating um uh you know for you ladies
you might assume that you know well we've had sex
therefore he's going to call me back right he's going
to have sex with me again not necessarily you might
be in for a rude awakening there um you know
you ladies might assume that oh you know i like
that guy and i sort of like i wanna i
wanna flirt with him i wanna i wanna approach him
but he but i want him to approach me but
he's not approaching me like so i'm gonna i'm assuming
that like i want to flirt with him but i
shouldn't because it's kind of like socially unacceptable for a
woman to initiate the guys supposed to initiate and if
i initiate with the guy before he initiates with me
then i'm going to come off like a [ __
] and then he's not going to want to be
in a relationship with me you could assume that and
then you actually go try it you flirt with him
you initiate and then you turn it it it works
great and then you you two end up getting married
you see um a lot of assumptions with sex you
know with sex for example it's important um in the
past i made a mistake of assuming a little bit
too much about like what the girl finds attractive and
what turns her on in sex in bed um and
i sort of i made the assumption that basically all
girls are turned on by the same sorts of mechanics
and imagery and other things in the bedroom and then
what i discovered as i got gained more experience and
had sex with with various people i discovered that actually
it's very important as the guy for example to to
actually question your girl about what turns her on the
most figure that out and customize your sexual style and
how you have sex to her to align with what
turns her on like um this is a little a
little bit graphic here but but hey this is a
real world example from my life so like all the
girls i've been with um up to the last one
they all love getting fingered and i got really good
at fingering girls and then i got into a relationship
with with with a new girl and um and like
she really didn't like getting fingered it was uncomfortable for
her like it didn't turn her on and for me
that at first that was weird i found that weird
because first of all i love doing it second of
all because like i was just i was in the
habit of doing that because it's that's how it worked
for the other girls but for this girl i had
to customize how i do things um you know to
make her more happy and that's just one example there's
other examples you know they like different positions some like
this position some don't like this position some positions for
some are painful some whatever so like basically the lesson
i took away from that is like going forward if
i'm having sex with a girl i'm gonna assume much
less and i'm gonna be more curious and kind of
inquiring to find out and figure out quickly what actually
turns it on so then i can just customize my
style to that and then it'll be a much better
experience for the both of us see rather than just
assuming when it comes to relationships further down you know
after you get attraction and sex and dating once you
get past that you get into a deep relationship deep
intimacy maybe even marriage and so forth you know long-term
relationships there so many assumptions will ruin your relationship when
it comes to communication communication is is the cornerstone of
any long-term relationship if you if you don't get the
communication right if you're not communicating consciously i guarantee you
your relationship will turn to [ __ ] so that's
the topic for today that i will cover i promise
we'll talk about conscious relationships and uh conscious communication but
anyways yeah there are so many assumptions that we make
when we're communicating especially in an intimate relationship about what
the other person's needs are what my needs are have
i communicated my needs have they commuted their needs are
we on the same page so so yeah um assumptions
[ __ ] up communication to communicate effectively you need
to get really clear that both sides are on the
same page and that we're not making different assumptions and
and this is why it's helpful after you communicate something
you can ask the person repeat back to me what
i told you just so that we're on the same
page so i knew so i can check if you
understood what i was trying to communicate and then vice
versa they can do that back to you this would
be important if you're trying to communicate something something serious
and significant another domain the last domain i'll talk about
here that's very practical is health and doctors i've been
dealing with some health problems over the last few years
uh i've been seeing a lot of doctors and um
and when i first started trying to figure out what's
going on with my body and so forth i had
various kinds of assumptions it might have been this it
might be that this doctor will help me that doctor
won't help me this pill will help me that pill
what would help me like there's a lot of different
assumptions i had to try to figure you know figure
out what's going on with me and um and a
lot of those assumptions turn out to be wrong so
the bottom line is if you have any kind of
like autoimmune disorder or other sorts of health issues that
you're dealing with you have to be very careful about
questioning your assumptions as you're troubleshooting your health issues and
you have to get multiple perspectives and try multiple things
and be very open and sort of non-ideological about how
you try stuff out um even with the kind of
diet that you eat and how you change your diet
you have to be you have to question all your
assumptions when it comes to diet things you thought were
healthy might turn out to actually worsen your condition for
example with my condition i have like a bacterial infection
in my stomach i was assuming at the beginning that
like fruits and vegetables were going to be very good
and healthy for me because hey fruits and vegetables everyone
says they're healthy right wrong it made the situation way
worse i had to cut out fruits and vegetables um
for my specific situation um i'm not saying you should
do that but anyways so like right so that was
an assumption you see assumptions can get you into a
lot of trouble and uh the only way i was
really able to start to resolve my situation now it's
under control and the only reason i was able to
get it under control is because i question that core
assumption that fruits and vegetables were healthy for me they
weren't not for my situation and that was extremely counter-intuitive
it took me over a year to get to the
point of questioning that assumption because that's a that's a
very sneaky one that you don't you don't really think
about so um also i want to stress to you
here that there are meta assumptions i've already alluded to
this a little bit but let's really underscore this so
you have assumptions about your assumptions that's what a meta
assumption is for example the assumption that you're not assuming
that's a meta assumption for example if i tell you
that jesus christ was a real person is an assumption
and you tell me oh no no that's not an
assumption see that's an assumption that it's not an assumption
that's your meta assumption um if you want to know
about med the the notion of meta go check out
my episode called um what it means to go meta
another meta assumption is the assumption that your assumption is
not a big deal this is a very sneaky one
that oftentimes happened when i'm trying to reason with scientists
and materialists you know i can tell a scientist that
you know you're assuming reality is finite and the scientist
might even say like yeah i'm assuming that but it's
not a big deal except it is a big deal
it's a huge [ __ ] deal or um or
for example i might tell a materialist something like you
know you're assuming that you can use science to understand
consciousness you're assuming that and he might even say yeah
okay i'm assuming that but it's not a big deal
but it's a big [ __ ] deal because science
is a figment of consciousness science is imaginary you can't
actually use science to understand consciousness because consciousness is imagining
science a huge [ __ ] deal or for example
you could tell a materialist or scientist you know you're
assuming that a finite self exists and they might say
yeah maybe i am assuming that but it's like so
what well but what you don't realize if you're assuming
the finite self that finite self distorts your entire perception
of reality and science if you truly realized the finite
self wasn't real all of science would collapse but you're
not you're not seeing that because you're assuming that uh
it's a little it's a little niggly detail it's like
no it's not a niggly detail it's the core foundation
of your entire worldview other examples of meta assumptions for
example sure science employs assumptions but that's not a big
deal because science just works we landed a man on
the moon therefore whatever assumptions exist within science they can't
be important that's a meta assumption um another example of
that assumption i'm not assuming that i'm a human this
basically denies that being a human is an assumption see
if i tell you you assume you're a human you
say no i'm not leo i'm not assuming that i'm
a human that's a meta assumption you're assuming that you're
not assuming but you are assuming or for example i
might say science is true is an assumption you hold
and you might say no leo science is is just
true it's not an assum that's not an assumption science
is true because it works but that's an assumption you're
in denial that that's an assumption that's a meta assumption
so look sense making making sense of reality requires a
lot of [ __ ] assumptions all right hundreds and
thousands of assumptions if you questions assumptions these assumptions deeply
enough how reality makes sense to you will radically change
and this will open up new possibilities limits that you
thought were part of reality will dissolve and i have
a little example here to show you this is the
nine dot problem i'm sure many of you have already
done this little puzzle and you know the answer so
if you know the answer to this already then this
is sort of falling on deaf ears but assuming this
is your first time seeing the nine dot problem here's
how it works i want you to actually try to
puzzle this out before i give you the answer i'm
gonna give you the answer in a minute but try
to puzzle this out so you have nine dots here
the objective of this little game is as follows draw
this on a piece of paper and try to connect
these nine dots using only four lines straight lines they
have to be straight without lifting the tip of your
pencil or pen from the paper so it has to
be a continuous four line segments however however you want
to draw them draw four line segments all contiguous connected
to each other and every dot needs to be touched
it needs to cross through every dot so that's the
puzzle pause this recording and actually try to do this
if you've never seen this before it's a challenging puzzle
but also the solution is devilishly simple but it requires
thinking outside the box that's why this example is so
good so when you see the solution i'm going to
show you the solution here in a second it's going
to be so obvious and it's going to reveal to
you an assumption that you held so what this puzzle
the reason this puzzle is so interesting and tricky is
that it operates on an implicit assumption that you have
about the puzzle so go try to puzzle it out
and now i'm going to give you the answer so
spoiler alert this is the answer try to actually work
it before you get the answer so now i'm going
to show you the answer and now you see it
and it's extremely obvious what the assumption was so your
assumption to make it explicit was that you have to
stay within draw your lines within the confines of the
dots you were drawing your lines from point to point
and what you didn't see because it was implicit is
that you can go outside of the nine dots you
can draw a line beyond the points the points don't
limit to where you can draw your lines and that's
what allows you to solve this puzzle this is literally
seeing outside the box see and so i'm using this
puzzle here this nine dot problem as a metaphor for
how your mind gets stuck within a paradigm within a
box within a certain set of assumptions and you're literally
unable to see outside of it it takes a genius
leap of insight to to see outside the box to
see the implicit assumptions that you were holding and when
you do that what you notice is that you're able
to solve challenges in life like this puzzle that you
could not solve otherwise so the puzzle is not solved
by drawing harder or drawing more lines the puzzle is
solved by seeing the situation in a more open expanded
way by seeing your own internal limitations so what happens
is that the overturning of deeply held implicit assumptions can
lead to rude awakening or shock or mind [ __
] or paradigm shift or a recontextualization i've talked about
all these concepts in the past i have an episode
about mind [ __ ] called the topic of mind
[ __ ] i have an episode about paradigm shifts
which is called how paradigms work i have an episode
about understanding recontextualization i've talked about rude awakenings a lot
surprises so this is how it works to see reality
in a radically different way that expands your your own
self-imposed limits this is one of the most amazing features
of the mind and of consciousness you see what people
take for granted especially materialists because they just assume a
material reality is they just assume that reality just is
how it is and therefore how we think about it
isn't a big deal that's true if reality is just
an objective material system but it's not as i've talked
about elsewhere reality is an infinite mind an infinite mind
when it imagines certain limits those limits become its reality
and so what's so cool about self-actualizing and spirituality is
that you can remove what you previously thought were physical
objective limits what you thought was physics you can remove
those limits just by changing how you see yourself and
reality that's what's so amazing about this work that's what
makes this work so much more powerful than normies assume
then scientists assume right it's possible to actually go underneath
the physics of reality not in all situations in certain
situations it's possible to do that and then it's possible
to realize incredible things that would otherwise seem crazy and
impossible and so in fact the most advanced spiritual truths
are inaccessible to most human minds simply because fundamental assumptions
have not been questioned deeply enough right like most people
assume that they're going to die and they don't understand
that death is an assumption and when you tell them
hey you know death is an assumption you hold they'll
say no no leo you're crazy that's crazy talk that's
some woo stuff that's unscientific no it's not unscientific it's
just that you need to go underneath [ __ ]
science you need to question science so deeply that you
deconstruct science and then you even deconstruct death and you
deconstruct physics of course but this seems so outlandish and
so crazy to the ordinary mind because the ordinary mind
is not used to questioning this deeply and it and
take for granted the significance of of holding these sorts
of assumptions it treats assumptions as some sort of like
minor stuff like you know little peanuts it's not peanuts
your death is not peanuts so a lot of the
things that i talk about sometimes rub people the wrong
way and people think that i'm crazy or a cult
leader or something because they assume that what i'm talking
about is some sort of belief system that i hold
or some sort of ideology that i'm trying to indoctrinate
you into but that's not what this work is about
what this work is about is questioning extremely deeply to
the point where then you have crazy epiphanies and realizations
that the ordinary mind cannot fathom the order of your
mind can't see some of these advanced things that i'm
talking about and therefore from its perspective the ordinary mind
must somehow explain this and make sense of what i'm
talking about and the way it does that is by
saying oh it's some sort of new age [ __
] or wishful thinking or it's an ideology or it's
a cult or it's just crazy that which you cannot
make sense of you call crazy so be careful that's
self-deception here's an exercise for you i want you to
make a list based on the following question what major
assumptions in your life turned out to be false grab
a piece of paper and start making a list every
major assumption that turned out to be false throughout your
whole life this will be very eye-opening for you and
then once you have this list ask yourself for each
item how did that affect you this assumption being false
how did that affect you what ramifications does this have
on your life did it cause suffering did it make
you happy did it make you depressed did it make
you want to kill yourself did it ruin your sex
life like what happened and also ask the question why
did you make those assumptions why did you assume that
in the first place what was this function what are
the functions of these assumptions so do that as a
homework assignment what you'll notice is that in many cases
you assume a thing because you want it or you
need it to be true a lot of times you
assume a thing because you can't emotionally stand the sting
and the pain of facing the truth that it isn't
true now i want you to ask yourself what would
happen if you spent the rest of your life questioning
all assumptions and that this was now something you were
proactively looking for in every situation whether it is in
your relationships in your love life in the way you
have sex in uh in your business in your career
in your schooling in the way you do science in
the way you pursue spirituality think about that also a
note i should warn you that if you do undertake
this project of questioning everything ruthlessly be careful because people
will not take kindly when you question their deepest assumptions
they will lash out at you they will act out
they will get emotional they will distract they will deflect
they will gaslight they will project they will attack and
they will demonize you why because assumptions are crucial for
survival so when you are questioning their assumptions you are
threatening their survival they need those assumptions to keep surviving
as themselves that's what they're committed to that's what life
is surviving as a finite self so see questioning assumptions
threatens constructions such as business institutions government universities the media
the military the church there are collective assumptions there is
group think there is collective ego it is easier to
defend assumptions from being questioned within a group which is
exactly why humans are so tribal and groupish because it's
actually easier to deceive yourself when you're doing it as
part of a collective activity with a tribe where everybody
else is also deceiving themselves that makes the deception look
like reality you see like for example if i just
print out a piece of paper on my printer and
i say this is a hundred dollar bill and this
is actually worth something and it's very very important if
i just do that for myself and nobody else does
that and money doesn't exist let's say in this situation
if i just print that for myself is that going
to have a lot of meaning for me this this
concept of money this piece of paper i printed out
let's say i print out a piece of paper that
says a million dollars on it a million dollar bill
is that gonna yeah am i gonna wake up in
the morning be like oh my god i'm this powerful
millionaire no it means nothing it's just my own personal
fiction but if every person agrees that this is a
million dollar bill and agrees to actually exchange this for
goods and services then this million dollar bill actually becomes
highly meaningful and highly valuable you see and so this
is how humanity generates a lot of its power it's
through these collective fictions but there's a cost it's sort
of amazing that we're able to construct these collective fictions
whether it's religion or media or science or money or
whatever um you know cryptocurrency nowadays i mean this is
effectively what cryptocurrency is um and it's worth like trillions
of dollars uh some of them anyways and and so
i mean that that's quite remarkable but there's there's always
a hidden cost and the hidden cost is that it
comes with certain assumptions and these assumptions now need to
be defended and sometimes they're they're defended to the death
people will kill each other over you know some cryptocurrency
or some money even though cryptocurrency and money are just
fictions but they're very useful fictions and if you get
enough people convinced of the fiction it becomes indistinguishable from
reality so humans we're constructing our own reality as we
go and that might seem on a certain on the
one hand it might seem great that we have so
much power on the other hand with so much power
we end up bullshitting ourselves and getting lost in our
own constructions you see like with organized religion how many
people have have you know bullshitted themselves and completely lost
their minds to organize religion millions and millions of people
and all sorts of craziness has come from that you
know war and torture and and rape and molestation god
knows what else has come from that um and it's
it's fiction it's fiction and of course we're not just
picking out religion here but like the media science politics
the military cults the new age business it all works
this way a lot of business you know how many
businesses would go out of business if we removed all
of the collective assumptions and group think and collective ego
that exists within our culture that puts certain value on
things you know like there are businesses that you know
cater to you know having long eyelashes you know they're
they're like i'm sure multi-billion dollar i mean eyelash extensions
are probably a multi-billion dollar industry and why why did
these eyelashes people buy these eyelashes because somehow in our
culture we got the assumption that maybe like you know
guys will want to like become your boyfriend if you
have long eyelashes or something like that they'll find you
more attractive you know there's an entire industry on plastic
surgery there's an entire industry on sports cars and tattoos
and all sorts of weird investment schemes and a lot
of these are just based on these collective fictions that
we come up with and various kinds of assumptions and
so when you start to question those people will get
angry at you because literally you're threatening their livelihoods you
know if i put out a video about how you
know you don't need eyelash extensions to get a boyfriend
or husband then you know the people who make eyelash
extensions will be upset at me for saying that even
though it might be true or maybe it's false i
don't know maybe maybe the eyelash extensions do help you
i don't know it's just a random example so just
understand that even though we're sort of dealing with philosophical
abstract issues here it might seem like it's just sort
of like very um you know immaterial stuff that we're
talking about we're talking about ideology we're talking about belief
systems and assumptions and group think like like this it
makes it seem like it's it's kind of frivolous it's
just like you know um but then what you have
to realize is that most of our society is built
on this [ __ ] and functions on this [
__ ] it functions on collective fictions so yeah don't
be surprised when you start to question these collective fictions
that your boss your co-workers your friends your family your
spouse even your children even that they they won't take
kindly to this because you're disturbing their dream you're robbing
them of their illusions that they have spent a lifetime
constructing because they're living in an illusion and they don't
want to wake up so be careful how you go
about it anyways in conclusion i want you to take
a way that is very worthwhile to invest time and
energy carefully sniffing out for hidden assumptions in all sorts
of areas of life this will pay dividends for you
the more you do it it's gonna it's gonna have
a snowball effect at first it's not gonna pay so
much dividends but if you keep doing it for years
and decades it will pay huge dividends and and then
lastly this is the heart of good epistemology and contemplation
in a sense when you're trying to do good epistemology
and you're trying to contemplate what you're doing is you're
trying to get you're trying to unearth implicit assumptions and
you're trying to question them very deeply and in that
sense that makes epistemology very simple but it's still not
easy to do because you have to have a very
open mind to be able to do this see my
episode about radical open mindedness and the importance of that
this is where that comes into play you have to
have a very open mind and you have to be
very persistent with it because it can take sometimes it
can take years of contemplating a thing before you reach
a simple insight about some simple assumption that you held
right so even though an assumption can be simple that
doesn't mean you can easily unearth it just like in
that nine dot puzzle example you know the solution is
very simple but it's not obvious and it can take
you hours to realize it might even take you a
lifetime to realize it until somebody gives you the answer
and then you're to say oh my god look how
obvious it was right so it's simple but it's not
easy and it can take a lot of time but
i hope i've convinced you that that investment is worth
it you
